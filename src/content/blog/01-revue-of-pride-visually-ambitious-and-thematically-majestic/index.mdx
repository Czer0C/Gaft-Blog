  <p>
    No matter how many times I rewatch this anime, it still leaves a profound
    impact on me with so many intricate elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, episode 3 - <strong>the 3rd revue </strong>to be more precise
    - is what fascinates me the most. Instead of cooling down from the first two
    beautiful stage plays prior to this episode, things went all out by heating
    the game to an astronomical level.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though the central theme of this revue isn’t too groundbreaking, what truly
    blows my mind away is the evocative <strong>visuality </strong>and the
    glorious <strong>OST</strong>, Hokori to Ogori (hats off to the spectacular
    performance by Maho-nee).
  </p>
  <p>
    Without further ado, let’s dive into one of the most iconic moments in this
    bizarre world of Revue Starlight.

      <b>Premise</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    As the stage came to life, the atmosphere shifted entirely from the cheerful
    tone of the slice-of-life on the <strong>surface</strong> to a fiery and
    solemn setting of the <strong>underground</strong> competition.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      The lighting usage is spot-on as the contenders made their entrances.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    While Karen casually made her debut, Maya gracefully descended from the
    summit. This prologue is likely a metaphor for their power gap.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>However, Maya isn’t one to look down on her foes.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    To demonstrate her title of being the 99th class leader, Maya had decided to
    examine this challenger by standing on <strong>equal ground</strong> with
    her.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite the enthusiasm emitted from the build-up, the opening is rather
    chilling as it gave off the impression of a majestic, high-class ball of the
    <em> </em>
    <strong>nobles </strong>than a regular duel between{" "}
    <strong>knights </strong>or whatever you wanna call the girls in this spooky
    playground.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      Nonetheless, things escalated fast as the Karen and Maya boldly affirm
      their stance.
    </em>

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It boggles the mind how quickly Maya shot Karen down with her desire to
    ascend the very top.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      While this, at first glance, reflects the <strong>arrogance</strong> of
      Maya, as the song’s title suggests, there is more to the context to
      consider.
      <br />
      <br />
      Karen is technically a newcomer to this Revue industry; hence her barging in
      and declaring that she’ll take the star tiara is kind of a part of her <strong>
        arrogance
      </strong> too.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    So in just a single line of the revue theme track, the arena was set ablaze
    as{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>neither of the girls was willing to back down</strong>
    </em>
    , which effectively brought us to the initial clash.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>First Impact</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What lies in your heart? What do your twinkling eyes seek?</p>
    <p>
      I still can’t reach that star, but for the sake of that promise, I’ll keep
      on charging ahead
    </p>
    <cite>
      <b>Karen</b>
    </cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Admittedly, this is quite a tricky part of the encounter since I'm not sure
    whether Karen was curious about Maya as a <strong>person </strong>or as a{" "}
    <strong>top star.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The latter would imply that Karen sought to defeat Maya regardless of what
    fueled her, for{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>that promise</em>
    </strong>{" "}
    was Karen's prime goal here.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the former leaned towards a{" "}
    <strong>personal interest</strong>, which I don't find to be the case
    because, as mentioned before, the <strong>promise</strong> is more important
    to Karen.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/shoujo-kagekie29886revue-starlight-03-11.mp4_.00_02_11_02.still005.webp"

      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    The fight raged on for a short while until Maya issued a brief pause.{" "}
    <em>Her eyes lit a strong sense of distraught</em> as she questioned Karen
    of her motivation behind her participation in the revue.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, it is noticeable how{" "}
    <em>
      Maya was able to effortlessly fend off Karen's fierce strikes, using just
      one hand to block her full blow
    </em>
    , which is pretty hype and, again, showcased the <strong>arrogance</strong> of
    Maya.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2020-12-09-17_41_37-greenshot.webp"

      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    I really love the way Maya delivered the <strong>"together?"</strong> in a
    pondered manner upon Karen's outrageous declaration. Most likely, there was
    only one thing that occupied her thought at the given time.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      How can such a prestigious mantle be "shared" by more than one person?
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Technically speaking, Karen's answer was rather disappointing,{" "}
    <em>at least from Maya's perspective.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    To Maya, this is <strong>heresy</strong>. The "holy grail" of the revue is
    meant for a single winner, nothing more, nothing less, hence her urge to{" "}
    <strong>fix </strong>this faulty notion of a naive Karen.
  </p>
  <p>
    This speaks volumes of Maya's straightforward nature since{" "}
    <em>idealism has no place to confront her.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, it appeared that Maya had been painted as your typical "boss"
    class antagonist with one sole objective in mind:{" "}
    <strong>utmost supremacy.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>However, is that really the case here?</p>
  <p>
    In my view, the second phase would tell us a different story in this regard,
    as Maya sincerely expressed herself in many elegant ways.
  </p>

    <h2>

  <p>
    No longer messing around, Maya unleashed her true might as the head of 99th
    class,
    <strong>
      {" "}
      bending reality, no, the stage to her own will, as the lyric implies.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't know about you, but this moment was just pure fire as{" "}
    <em>
      the way the details of the revue slowly interwove and danced to Maya's
      tune
    </em>{" "}
    is just a sight to behold.
  </p>
  <p>
    So far, <strong>red </strong>and <strong>gray </strong>have been the main
    palettes of this revue. This, of course, is no strange thing for they
    represent the girls respectively, mostly from their outfit design.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  <p>
    As Maya finished her chanting, the theater came into full view in all of its
    glory.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      The roles are now reversed, Karen is no longer the challenger, but
      instead, it was Maya who was taking total control and non-stop taunting
      her opponent with <strong>pride and arrogance.</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The atmosphere now consisted of nothing but glowing spirits between the
    actors, thus further accentuated the tragic undertone behind the harsh truth
    of this <strong>vicious cycle</strong>.

  <p>
    While it is undeniable that Maya is inherently competitive, she, however,{" "}
    <strong>
      does acknowledge those who put their best on the line when facing her.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For the record, there hasn't been any instance of Maya looking down on other
    opponents.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>The Tip Of The Iceberg</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    It might be a bit irrelevant to the topic but, earlier in episode 3, almost
    every moment featuring Maya is merely her seemingly taking some random
    glances and sending greetings to her peers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unexpectedly, when this stage manifested, all of these elements would then
    hold much more value and <strong>weight </strong>than they originally
    appeared to.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
    <img

  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      The essence behind Maya's character is to take the top spot by giving her
      all, holding nothing back, even if it means transforming into a{" "}
      <strong>beast</strong>.<br />
      <br />
      This goes to show how tempting and distasteful the environment of creating
      the <strong>best of the best</strong> is.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Therefore, Karen's idea of reaching the top star{" "}
    <strong>with someone else</strong> is a pipedream, a ludicrous wish to Maya;
    hence her being mildly furious and going all out in this second phase.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is but one lone star on the stage</p>

      <b>Maya</b>
    </cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The best thing about this revue is how it not only{" "}
    <strong>solidified Maya's character and ideal</strong> but also served as a
    subtle <strong>foreshadowing</strong> for something much more climactic to
    come.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who have already finished the anime, you can already tell the
    reason for this quick line-up shot as Maya poured her heart out with the
    song and dance.

    I mean, everything adds up, to be honest, when you look at this series as a
    whole and connect this segment with "something" in the later events to come,
    it's simply mesmerizing (<strong>NANA </strong>HYPE).

    Maya's resolution might not be absolute and flawed from the context of the
    story, it still strikes me as a practical approach to the revue or
    competition in general.

  <p>
    No matter how you look at it, there can only be one winner, which ultimately
    led us to the final phase, the climax.

    Maya reinforces her ideal by proclaiming to reach an{" "}
    <strong>infinite height</strong>, and IMO this is where Maya truly shines as
    a character.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think about it, Maya is like a monarch standing on top of the mountain,
    undefeated, uncontended, yet she refused to rest on her laurels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite her recognizing and understanding the pains, despairs, and tragedies
    that shallow the fallen ones,{" "}
    <strong>Maya would not feel pity for them</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, she strives to push herself further. Not because she doesn't care
    about her peers,{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>but as a means to pay her respect to them.</em>
    </strong>

  <div className="special-quote">

      <strong>
        The top star means nothing without those failing to reach it

      . In truth, only desolation and despair await the defeated.

      <br />
      YET, painful as it is, <em>Maya must carry on</em>.<br />
      <br />
      Otherwise, everything she had done would prove to be meaningless, and the

      <br />
      For those who were chasing behind her, and as proof of her determination, Maya

    Anyway, getting back on the topic, Karen found herself being utterly
    overwhelmed by Maya's brilliance as she struggled and unable to get an
    opening to make her way through.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, Maya was relentlessly toying with her prey. Every time she was
    close to receiving an attack from Karen, Maya would then widen the gap by{" "}
    <strong>fiddling the stage as she will it</strong>, which is insanely epic
    and out-of-this-world.

    <em>Eventually, the moment of truth drew near.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    When Karen exhausted herself and realized that she was facing an immovable
    wall, Maya valiantly delivered the finishing blow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Incidentally, as she let her emotion got the best of her, Claudine was also
    seen to be having an intense battle in a different arena.

    And just like that, the curtain fell on the <strong>Revue of Pride</strong>{" "}
    with Maya once again reaffirmed her resolve to stand on top, alone.

    <h2>
      <b>Afterthought</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    I must say episode 3 as a whole, and this revue, in particular, was{" "}
    <strong>meticulously and masterfully crafted in every way</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was so much foreshadowing, subtlety, and foils running together to
    raise the bar and suspense on top of a flawless assemble of theatrical
    showdown backed by a majestic <strong>theme track</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>directing </strong>is one thing, but damn, all those{" "}
    <strong>choreography </strong>shots and the non-cut, flashback, etc just
    refused to let up the stream of hype and thrill.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the <strong>lighting </strong>deserves a medal here, for they
    pretty much captured the <strong>semi-gloomy </strong>atmosphere while
    maintaining the passion and tension as consistent with the nature of a revue
    in this anime.
  </p>
  <p>
    For an anime to have achieved so many feats while retaining the core value
    of the plot, themes, and characters, it's not something I can hope to
    witness every once in a while.

    On a different note, just an FYI,{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>I'm not writing this analysis to denounce Karen whatsoever.</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I confess that my bias for Maya is high, but I by no means use that as an
    excuse to talk down on Karen. Still, fact remains that she had made several
    mistakes at this point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Karen did redeem herself in the endgame and even surpassed Maya in some ways
    because, after all, her theme is <strong>evolution</strong>, so I don't have
    anything against that.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this post's main focus is <strong>episode 3</strong> alone, so
    welp.
  </p>
  <p>
    To wrap this up, the <strong>Revue of Pride</strong> is hands down my
    personal favorite stage play despite its <strong>early </strong>presence in
    the grand scheme of things, which more or less get overshadowed later on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, as someone who also participates in competitive activity,
    <em>
      {" "}
      I can pretty much identify myself with this spectacular revue as well as Maya
      the lone star
    </em>
    {" , so yeah, what a wild ride it was. "}
