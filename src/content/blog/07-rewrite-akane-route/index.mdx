  <p>
    Similar to some well-known visual novels featuring the time-loop/multi-verse
    theme, Rewrite made use of the formula above to illustrate a world tree with
    not too-shabby complexity, thus opening up a myriad of opportunities for
    experimentations and the likes, one of which is without a doubt the infamous
    Akane route.

    This post won't touch upon the other routes or the end-game material much
    because I'd probably have more negative things to say about them. But I
    digress, just this one time I'm willing to overlook all of that
    transgression and instead shift my gaze onto Akane's story because the
    overall design for her character from the common route to her dedicated
    route to her dynamic with the protagonist had seamlessly given way to
    intriguing topics and the underlying themes that won over my attention and
    even caught me off guard in the most random way ever.
  </p>
  <p>
    For starters, her route went all in right off the bat with "raw" material
    like political struggle, coming-of-age progress, no BS convos that just get
    straight to the point without hiding anything, and lastly they had no qualms
    with out-of-place topics like extreme cultic, erasing mankind or killing off
    people like it's Tuesday, and even character corruption (a bit), all of
    which are not something I'd normally expect from Key of all studio out
    there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm aware that a <s>few</s> LOT of them are red flags like the whole
    genocide advocate and how icy the heroine in question can be, but in their
    defense, all of them more or less were justified by the context Rewrite
    world-building, so I'm not really bothered by that much. On top of that,
    it's exactly because Akane was so cold that her endgame paid off very well.

      YOOOO, THE HYPE IS REAL (<em>or not</em>, more on this later xd)

  </figure>
  <p>
    I mean can you really blame her when literally visions worth several hundred
    years of human life full of traumatizing content were compressed into the
    mind of a fragile human being? If anything it's stunning that Akane didn't
    go full zombie mode like her predecessor did and even managed to hold on
    tight to her tiniest ray of hope for a comeback. This shit is basically
    equivalent to "Path" from AOT (<em>wut memory this even from</em>? xd),
    reading steiner from Steins;Gate or Quantum Causality from Muv-luv bla bla
    you get the idea, just too much for a girl who can only enjoy FPS games like
    Akane to absorb xd
  </p>

  <p>
    One thing to remember is that Akane was initially portrayed as a loner
    (befitting her hobby of playing fps games) and always drew a clear line
    between her and her peers, completely treating them like “NPCs” and ready to
    drop them out of her game at any given second. However, that changed in her
    own route as she went out of character for once to entrust her fate into the
    hand of someone who at first is strange but in time transformed into her
    escapism as she was constantly being put under pressure and had her sanity
    ripped apart due to the holy woman influence. It was more or less a domino
    effect, from the thought of “it’s no harm keeping him around” to “Oh shit I
    need him to get me outta here” as the story reached the finish line.
  </p>

    In other words, Akane route is pretty deceptively sophisticated with the
    premise of breaking off one’s shell and changing yourself by just shifting
    your view to a slightly different angle. The recurring pattern in the common
    route is Akane not giving a fuck about anything or anyone and doing things
    her own way. Contrary to her easygoing manner that is always present in the
    club room, it looked more like Akane had been living in another dimension of
    her own. This leans on the idea that she had already given up on her future
    after inheriting the will of the Holy Woman which engulfs the host with
    nothing but negative and twisted envisage of a hopeless and inevitable
    reckoning upon mankind.
  </p>
  <p>
    From her perspective, nothing she could do would change anything, they were
    already at the “point of no return” as she quoted, hence might as well do
    whatever she wanted before the hours lay upon her.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

      className="kg-image"

  <p>
    That all changed as her route began, with Akane slowing down her pace and
    taking a glance at her surroundings in another light, thus triggering a
    positive chain reaction as her journey continued. To me, this is a clear
    reflection of our daily life, that is to change the world you must first
    change yourself (a direct answer to her questionnaire from the common
    route).
  </p>
  <p>
    While it is true that Akane was dead-set on fulfilling her role as the holy
    woman by hastening the destruction of the planet, a tiny part inside her
    asked for the opposite, which is why she even took in Kotaro in the first
    place because she was hoping he could drag her out of this hell hole or at
    least "releasing" her from this miserable fate. Thanks to that slight bit of
    contradiction between her subconscious and the Gaia influence, the finale of
    her stage was laced with immense hype and I could not stop cheering for
    Akane for some reason even though the outcome was blindly obvious (
    <strong>
      <em>
        maybe it is not too late to start the "Akane did nothing wrong" train
        lol
      </em>
    </strong>
    ).

      <strong>NO REGRET</strong>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    At the risk of repeating myself, to me what makes a quality character is how
    consistent and firm they are in their belief, regardless of the consequences
    they'd stay unwavering and remain true to themselves against all odds, and
    the same can be said for Akane too. Their ideology can be wrong, twisted,
    misplaced, or deranged, but so long as they fully demonstrate their
    conviction without fail then <strong>I just can't say no to that</strong>,
    especially since it's in a fictional work it doesn't hurt to go wild
    sometimes xd
  </p>
  <p>
    All said and done, while I have given plenty of praise for this particular
    fragment of Rewrite, there were still some lingering matters that left much
    to desire such as some good ol' fashioned bad ending choices:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Killing Akane as a way to end her suffering. The reason why it's not an
      atonement for her sins is simply because that's not something that'd align
      with Kotaro character as he decided to stick with her despite knowing the
      dark path they'd be heading. However, I think it's not that far-fetched to
      provide an extra scenario where Kotaro, or you as the reader xd, can no
      longer bear watching her in any more pain, similar to putting down a
      patient beyond saving (if that's legal in some countries).
    </li>
    <li>
      A more extreme ending would be you choosing to sink with Akane to the
      darkest pit of Tartarus. Meaning, from the start to the very end of the
      story you'll be her right-hand, support her ideology, and commit all sorts
      of atrocities to ensure the success of Gaia's plan which is aiding the Key
      (another pun??) in the process of purging the Earth of humanity (aye yo
      this sounds just like a certain mecha anime in the 90s mmmmm). Basically
      kinda like in the anime adaptation (ss1) but instead of opposing Akane
      you'll be standing by her side and slowly fade away together and stuff,
      would be cool.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Apart from that, I think it's kinda weird that Akane got off very lightly
    despite what she did, I mean fucking hell sure she didn't do it with her own
    hand but the fact is that she gave the order for her subordinates to carry
    out the plan and almost created real OG "Thanos snap" saved for maybe 10% of
    humanity in the utopia whatever. And what did they do to her? An exile. Like
    wow, can you even call that punishment when we all know she has
    communication issues and dislikes the crowd, so to be able to get far away
    from the mass with her lover to a secluded, unknown destination sounds a lot
    more to me like winning a lottery for a luxury honeymoon trip rofl.

    But that's alright, those were not a big deal (good fanservice even) but
    what pissed me off most was this WAY OVER THE TOP frame in the 2nd OP was
    complete bait and has no actual meaning whatsoever. WHY EVEN GO OUT OF YOUR
    WAY TO MAKE THIS TEASER AND GIVE NOTHING EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BIT IN THE END
    ANYWAY. Seriously, how cool would it be if there was a scene or CG like that
    in the actual story???? And they had no budget to make sprites for side
    characters like Suzuki or Sakura who showed up quite a lot in the late-game
    but had the audacity to troll us with that awesome frame??? Just what the
    fuck Key.

    Aww well whatever, I honestly am not sure how I really feel about Rewrite as
    a whole, but you can bet your ass that I enjoyed the hell out of Akane
    route, it was so refreshing to see Key being out of character for once and
    almost nailing everything. Lastly, I think while Akane didn't possess any
    fancy CG like the other heroines, the final scene with her and Kotaro
    walking with that title drop (<strong>A Journey of a Thousand Miles</strong>
    ) was just simply kino.
