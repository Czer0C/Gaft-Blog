    <h3>[SPOILERS WARNING]</h3>
    <h3 />
  </center>
  <p>
    This is going to be kinda a rant post but whatever. For people who didn't
    know, Sprite had plans for a sequel of Aokana but it never came to reality.
    Some time ago, the internet leaked the teaser (
    <strong>with a vocal version of the track Ao no Kanata He</strong>) , and
    some storyboard panels featuring a new heroine who appears to be Irina's
    sister, who also was mentioned quite often during the first installment of
    the novel.
  </p>

    But yeah, the point is, Aokana 2 was going to be a thing, and Saki should
    have been able to claim a spot on the grand stage because they spilled a lot
    of hints in the first part and you can totally tell that her story wasn't
    complete, it felt like a halfbaked buildup and served as a plot device to a
    certain extent. Regardless, the fact remained that there was some emphasis
    on her presence, thus proving that Sprite had set things up for her and just
    waited for a full-fledged sequel to roll.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, I'm still going to share my view on her, based on how she was
    portrayed in the original game plus some interpretations there and then.

  <p>
    Overall, I think Inui Saki is quite misunderstood for a large part of the
    story. They painted her up to be some sort of edgy player who tends to bully
    the weak (which was not really off the mark but more on that later), but
    most of the time that was just the main characters narrating the story
    quickly jumped to their conclusion. The majority of what you know about Saki
    was mostly indirect, either someone was just spitting what they "think they
    know" or some shady video clips, they did not even get to see her speak up
    and just decided for themselves that she's bad, so yeah it all felt very
    shallow and mysterious, just the tip of the iceberg.
  </p>
  <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

  <p>
    Looking back, while Irina was the one who came up with the sadistic plan to
    crush the fun out of FC, Saki simply followed her order. The thing about
    Saki is that she's just terrible at communication, you don't get to see
    what's really on her mind until the very end. The people around her only saw
    her as the villain because of how intimidating her playstyle is, without
    understanding how she felt inside. Sure, being considerate should be part of
    common sense, but in sports, you don't need to always express yourself, and
    just focus on what matters, which is winning. The concept of "play to win"
    vs "play for fun" is a delicate one.

    <figcaption>
      these eyes just speak up for her determination to win no matter what
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    I myself have once participated in competitive gaming (almost felt like
    e-sport) and I can tell you how toxic and negative it can get. At first, you
    convinced yourself that you don't care about winning and just trying to do
    your best or choose to do off-meta for the fun, but at one time your urge to
    win might rise and become brakeless, thus transforming you into a different
    person as a result.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what I'm trying to say here, is Saki was first portrayed as a stone-cold
    player who didn't care how her opponents feel during the match, which is not
    a big deal when you think it's the nature of the competition overall. If
    anything it looked like they were just being sore losers. Not like she ever
    trash-talked them or anything, she came to the first tournament, humbled
    their best player, refused to elaborate then left the scene like a Chad.

  <p>
    The reality is, Saki herself only ever wanted to fly, and flying was about
    one of a few things on her mind. She voluntarily chose the role of the bad
    guy to further Irina's goal and was ready to accept solitude by flying so
    high that no one else would be capable of catching up, just as her nickname
    suggests, a monarch of the sky. People are often afraid of the unknown, and
    because Saki never opened up herself, the fear of her surroundings would
    just keep growing, and so she was bound to be forever deemed as a devil.

    Also not sure if this was intentional but when she activated her Agravain
    phase 2 her whole aura kinda resemble that of a bat, which is something
    likened to living in the dark so kinda poetic right there.

    It was not until the match with Asuka that we finally get to see the full
    character of Saki, and I think it was worth reserving that timid part of her
    for the late game to add up more spice to the climax. Saki in the end just
    had a problem with dealing with people, she didn't know or understand how to
    make friends, and people often mistake her as being rude or evil bla bla,
    but only Asuka saw through that poker face of hers and took the initiative
    to create an opportunity for something positive between them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is why Asuka route is the best imo because of how well they pierce
    everything together along the road. It wasn't even a overused rivalry trope,
    instead, they opted for a straightforward clash of ideals that resolved
    succinctly without any long-winded sequences.

    <p class="g-grid__text">
      <strong>Hot take.</strong> The whole character design behind Saki is
      essentially a counter-thesis of that of Asuka. To elaborate, Saki was made
      out to be your average Joe with no special ability whatsoever. I mean,
      think about it, she just practiced, researched, and experimented hard to
      come up with what she and Irina believed to be the optimal way to play FC.
      In the process, she set her priority straight to reach the desired
      destination and thus dampened her ability to make friends as she had
      nothing else on her mind other than FC =&gt; the stone-cold outward was
      merely an accident.

  </figure>
  <p>
    On the other hand, Asuka should be considered the prodigy child. She's
    someone who's completely new to the game but managed to revolutionize FC
    almost immediately. So yeah, you get the idea, normally, Asuka as the main
    character should be the underdog with nothing at her disposal besides "hard
    work". I mean sure, Asuka also trained a lot with other people but compared
    to the insane amount of effort Saki put into throughout the years since her
    childhood, boi, that's just nuts how fast she grew.
  </p>
  <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">

      even with this insane amount of training on regular basis and she still

  </figure>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, Saki as the antagonist was{" "}
    <strong>supposed to be the genius one</strong> who just fucking goat at
    everything and having little weakness bla bla. However, as mentioned above,
    in Aokana she just "worked hard". I think this right here is what also makes
    me enjoy Asuka route a lot, they just flipped the ideas around AND mixed
    them, but not without remaining consistent to the end and it all paid off.
  </p>
  <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption kg-width-full">

  <p>
    And while we're talking about the meta, I think the match between Saki and
    Asuka wasn't entirely asspull for the protagonist's side. I mean Saki might
    have had the upper hand with Agravain 2.0, but that's it, it's her final
    card, her limit, if you present something else that could top Agravain 2.0
    then that's her loss.
  </p>
  <p>
    This goes in sync with how "ordinary" of a player she was, she was just
    someone who practiced hard, and that lead her to that final game with Asuka,
    being backed up by the esteemed science crew and the state-of-the-art
    technology run by her school, all of that made her head and shoulder above
    the average FC players.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet again, all these power requires progress, it was the result of how much
    effort Saki and her team put in, and they didn't come out at the drop of the
    hat, so for her to face an unforeseeable opponent with a new ceiling was
    nigh impossible to find a way out during that short time of the game.
  </p>
  <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">

      src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dxyxhzwdx/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2023/08/2020-03-28-16_41_43-Aokana.webp"

  <p>
    On the contrary, Asuka, by turning off the balancer, had managed to
    unshackle her latent power and was able to turn the tide of the game and
    raise the bar to another level or two. Since she's a prodigy, this does not
    feel out of the loop from how I see it, you can say the non-default setting
    of the Anti-Grav had been nerfing Asuka all the time so yeah, kinda hax but
    it is what it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    So to sum it up, while Saki and Asuka are in the same tier as FC players,
    their styles just clash against each other. On the red corner, Saki follows
    the traditional "slow and steady" approach which takes time to accumulate
    strength and sharpen her skill. In the blue corner, Asuka is simply
    uncontested in her ability to adapt and react to any huge wall laid in front
    of her. Like a fearless child who yearn to know more about her world, she'd
    unfazedly learn to walk the sky regardless of how bleak the situation is.
  </p>
  <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      class="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dxyxhzwdx/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2023/08/2020-03-28-16_38_36-Aokana.webp"

      height={1080}
      loading="lazy"
      width={1920}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Moreover, Saki decided to go out of character for once to ignore Irina's
    order and gave up on the idea of "play to win" to opt for the "fun" part,
    thus risking her chance of salvaging the situation. For many people that
    seem like Tuesday for them, but for Saki, that was the day of her life, when
    she dared to take a step up and break off her shell.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, she did mention trying to win for Irina but this time it felt a
    lot different than the usual one-sided matches where she was completely
    remorseful of the situation. So in a sense, it was not a good move for Saki
    in that final match, because, unlike Asuka, she cannot adapt quickly to
    spontaneous changes, but that change serves as a stepping stone that'd
    benefit her later as she discovered another fuel for her desire to fly,
    which will take time to come to show its true form (zwei never).
  </p>
  <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      class="kg-image hoverZoomLink"

      width={1843}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    You can say that both oppositions had gained their motivation and were
    striving to win while having fun, and so they put everything on the tables
    in that fateful finale, which was the key element of the final act in Asuka
    route.
  </p>
  <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      class="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dxyxhzwdx/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2023/08/2020-03-28-23_05_54-Aokana.webp"

  </figure>
  <p>
    All and all, I think Saki as a character was more than qualified to become
    something more phenomenal than she already was, had she not been robbed of a
    dedicated route. Everything you know about Saki in the first Aokana is more
    or less teasers and build-up, as there were a lot of holes in her story and
    motivation or so. But even if we disregard that sequel, I think they've done
    a good job of designing her as a counter-thesis for Asuka whose route also
    gathers more attention and care imo, which further reinforces the idea of
    Saki having a comeback in the sequel that might never come. But again, what
    is hyped may never die, and I'll keep waiting until that day arrives.
