<div className="richtext pb-8">
  <p>
    For some time, I have been pondering about the main <strong>drive</strong>{" "}
    that made me keep grinding anime after anime despite a{" "}
    <em>large chain of disappointment</em> in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what do I know? Out of the blue, this anime, Vivy Fluorite Eye's Song
    introduced itself and incoherently reminds me that, even though anime itself
    carries a variety of distinct drawbacks, it is also the one medium packed
    with <strong>unlimited potentials </strong>to become something much more
    than a mere piece of entertainment.

    <h2>
      <b>Story &amp; World-Building</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    The plot of VF is not something too groundbreaking, I'd say, but the selling
    point lies in the way it is <em>catered to detail</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has coherent plotlines loaded with twist after twist and exciting
    revelations followed by emotional and dramatic outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be more specific, this series doesn't rely on a formulaic approach and
    has succeeded in <strong>subverting expectations</strong> in a good way.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-04-26-00_21_17-Greenshot-1.webp"

    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Apart from that, while it contains some predictable events, the{" "}
    <em>execution never went astray </em>to deliver the highest quality possible
    of a momentary outburst. Hence, even if you already know what will happen,
    you can still expect to get pumped up by the brilliant resolution they came
    up with.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, no matter how big an event or incident has been laid
    out/focused on, they all serve a <strong>purpose</strong>, have a
    <strong> meaning</strong>, and even get a <strong>callback</strong> later on
    in the story, which is pretty commendable from a writing standpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    And to put the cherry on top, Vivy Fluorites would often feature
    thought-provoking themes regarding the meaning of being{" "}
    <strong>"alive"</strong> and such, which can get very cathartic.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img

  <p>
    If there's anything to complain about, well, it's funny because{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>
        Vivy Fluorite's advantage also contributes to its own shortcoming.
      </strong>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Given how grandiose the AI subject can get, oft time the flow of the story
    might get somewhat <strong>convoluted </strong>and feels awfully{" "}
    <strong>convenient</strong>, especially when it comes to the character's{" "}
    <strong>resolve </strong>in general.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-06-03-23_31_59-Greenshot.webp"

    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    On top of that, having a fast-paced story is not always a good thing. While
    it ensures substantial plot progression and shaping up world-building,
    sometimes the expositions appear to be <strong>hastily assembled</strong> or{" "}
    <strong>rushed</strong> in the middle of the heat, which{" "}
    <em>ruins the atmosphere</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, these are not really significant issues as the anime knows how to{" "}
    <em>ride on its momentum </em>and world-building to make up for this
    predicament, so nicely done, I'd add.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-04-25-23_17_25-Greenshot.webp"

  <p>
    Speaking of world-building, this is a big plus in my book. The
    A.I/cyberpunk-ish theme is not new nowadays, but the tradeoff is a{" "}
    <strong>transparent system</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>striking venue designs</strong> that constantly got me hyped and in
    awe of those "scenery."
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd dare say it gives off a strong <strong>fantasy </strong>vibe despite
    being 90% cyberpunk-ish. Simply put, an ambitious setup that totally has
    what it takes to back up the stake and sure as well delivered.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">

  <p>
    On a different note, whether it was intentional or not, I constantly ran
    into references from other media such as{" "}
    <strong>
      Ergo Proxy, Perfect Blue, Baldr Sky, Heaven's Feel, Dies Irae, Kikokugai,
      Oblivion, Tron Legacy, Blade Runner 2049, Matrix.
    </strong>{" "}
    So, man, I must say that I'm delighted to have run into this anime because
    rarely have I been treated this much.

    <h2>
      <b>Cast</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Moving on to the cast of Vivy Fluorite, I must give them that they are
    really <em>well crafted</em> from design, voice acting, and development
    throughout the show.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/Fluorite-Eye-s-Song---07--00_17_57_11.Still005-1.webp"

      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Whether they are assigned a minor role or play a crucial part to the plot,{" "}
    <em>there's always room</em> for each of them to shine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vivy is the protagonist that underwent a considerable amount of character
    "shift." At some point, it is <strong>physically </strong>(well, somewhat),
    some other time, <strong>mentally </strong>(again, not literally but
    whatever).
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned above, while there exist some{" "}
    <em>shenanigans or simply AI "hack" </em>with the humanization thingy, the
    end result is that with every action that Vivy takes, it always comes with{" "}
    <strong>consequences</strong>, be it positive or not, which also came up as
    a myriad of poignant development as the journey continues.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/Vivy-Ep-4---15.webp"
      alt=""
      height={1080}
      loading="lazy"
      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    As for the side characters, what else can I give but praise for the{" "}
    <strong>balanced </strong>amount of entertainment and heartfelt value that
    they have to offer?
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, at some point of the ride, there would come two characters who
    absolutely stole the spotlight away from Vivy <strong>(E4</strong>), and to
    me, that has been one of the most spectacular thematic showdowns I've had in
    a while.

    <h2>
      <b>Animation &amp; Directing</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Coming from studio Wit, it's no surprise that Vivy Fluorite will shower the
    audience with sublime aesthetics to kick it up a notch. In other words,
    eye-candy animation, first-rate choreographed action sequences, and
    exquisite still-frame are common occurrences in this anime.

    What's more, the <em>components </em>are all well thought out with careful
    planning to make the most out of the story and character.
  </p>
  <p>
    To name a few, magnificent closed-up shots emphasizing character expression,
    gestures are taken great care to bring out subtle interactions. The{" "}
    <strong>eye expression</strong>, however, is undoubtedly the best element in
    this regard.

    That said, to me, it is the astounding display of directing that pretty much{" "}
    <strong>interlinked </strong>all of the critical segments.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, Vivy Fluorite has some seriously insanely mesmerizing color palette
    and lighting that all blend in together to formulate a matching atmosphere
    and content delivery.

    The transition is nothing but visual treats, featuring a clear formating of
    21:9 for flashback or premonition, then fluidly switch back to 16:9 for the
    presence. In other words, good ol'{" "}

    Regardless, at certain points of the show, <strong>inconsistencies </strong>
    in quality would arise. For example, clunky flow and transitions or inappropriate
    choice of tone in the context of certain arcs, thus provoking more <strong>
      contrast{" "}
    </strong>than usual and somewhat dampening the experience.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>Sound Design</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    When it comes to anime,{" "}
    <em>sound is usually the least fascinating factor</em> to many people.
    However, just this one time, I'm forced to revalidate that mindset.
  </p>
  <p>
    The supreme sound system of Vivy Fluorite is easily the single best thing
    that it has at its disposal. From the OP, ED, insert tracks, hype battle
    music, to even ambient background sound (BLADE RUN... ok I'll stop), Vivy
    Fluorite wholeheartedly poured out the best of the best of its capability to
    create such a delicate sound system.
  </p>
  <p>
    For once, as standalone instances, they are great tracks. But for this
    anime, it's not just about composing a nice piece of music or possessing
    dedicated singers, but more so about giving them a <strong>goal</strong>,
    just so they can shine very brightly on the "stage" without being treated as
    mere decors.
  </p>
  <p>
    To put it bluntly, depending on the "version" of a track or the context of
    the story, you will have a complete change of perspective or{" "}
    <em>how a song is received</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only that, I'd even go as far as saying when putting 2 different songs
    side by side (the 2 OP), you get a <strong>complete picture</strong> of a
    particular character, how her conflict is portrayed in a very roundabout yet
    effective way.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-embed-card">
    <iframe
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
      allowFullScreen=""
      frameBorder={0}
      height={113}
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2p8ig-TrYPY?feature=oembed"
      width={200}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    To go beyond that, the "sound" element doesn't stop at having a concise aim
    and purpose in the story. It even "invades" the meta by having a{" "}
    <strong>clear structure</strong> to squeeze out the absolute most of its
    potential and value, which is an excellent decision from the production
    team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only does it break the cycle of{" "}
    <em>"adding music just for the sake of adding music"</em>, but it also
    delivers a rarely seen side of anime, which is to use sound as a reliable{" "}
    <strong>foundation </strong>for almost everything else in the series (well,
    it's still an idol show in the end so lel).
  </p>
  <p>
    On a different note, while being a heavily music-centric anime,{" "}
    <em>Vivy Fluorite gets its priority straight.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Sound is sound. It's only a means to an end, which is why it's crucial
    knowing how to use them rather than cranking them up without any plan nor
    consideration for the context of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the volume is toned down at battle scenes, just so they won't
    overshadow the actual content that's running on the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or given the circumstance of an event, sound distortion was also put into
    good use to captivate the tragedy or bitterness of the grand scheme of
    things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Timing is also of paramount importance, especially when the flow of the
    event needs to be coherent.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      In short, having the suitable material (composer, voice actors) + solid
      outlining + seamless execution = supreme sound system of Vivy Fluorite.
    </p>
  </div>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>Bottomline</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    To wrap this up, Vivy Fluorite's Eye Song truly{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>deserves the hype</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    it has been gathering IMO.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fact that it is an original anime (despite being influenced by other
    works), has a daring approach in its storytelling/execution, on top of being
    backed by an arsenal of remarkable assets like top tier animation and sound
    design just prove that anime as a medium has so many possibilities that
    could <strong>individually morph into something phenomenal</strong> their
    own.
