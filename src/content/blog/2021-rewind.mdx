<div className="richtext pb-8">
  <p>
    With 2020 being a rather passive year, I'd say I'm quite happy with how 2021
    turned out for my continued venture deep into the 2D realm.
  </p>
  <p>
    To tell the truth I still have a few more series on my backlog that I wish
    to finish before the end of the year but I learn my hard lesson last year
    that procrastination is unavoidable no matter how hard I tried to adhere to
    the predesigned plan so I decided not to bother with any major work till
    2022 arrives.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the amount of series I that managed to finish this year is quite
    modest, I did really stumble upon a few outstanding 2D creations that I
    never expected to tread over especially given the fact that I'm practically
    "retired" from the big game and can't care less what is going on with the
    social media or latest trending or stuff like that.
  </p>
  <p>
    But to get back on track, while visual novel remains dominant in all of the
    mediums, I was totally pleased to know, nay, to witness it with my own eyes
    that anime itself is still going strong as it has been in the past. For
    real, all of the mumble-jumble about "golden era" and crap is just getting
    very sickening to hear of. It doesn't matter what time or era you're in,
    you're never late to embrace greatness, <em>that itself is pure fact.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Before diving into the main part, do keep in mind, however, that{" "}
    <strong>
      this is not a list for stuff that necessarily came out in 2021
    </strong>
    , but more so about my "discovery" that occurred in the same year (so yeah <em>
      there ought to be some <strong>old</strong>{" "}
      <strong>schkool classic</strong>
    </em> got mixed up in the midst of the flow but you get the point).

    A gimmicky continuation of the SSSS. franchise. The whole third act was far
    from being chewable mostly thanks to the wonky plot structure, yet from a
    technical standpoint, the build-up AND the atmosphere were really well
    handled.

    Proceed with caution, for the testosterone and manly energy exerted from
    this anime might be too overwhelming for those who have long delved into the
    degenerate path.

    Truly a bomb for 2021, all the things you ever know about AI and robots and
    shit, wrapped up in one nice package laced with the combined might of
    stellar soundtracks and eye-popping cinematography.

    Key's very first work and sadly there are quite a considerable number of
    problems in terms of plot and characters. Still managed to muster up a
    little bit of gloomy atmosphere anyhow.

    A whimsical mix of slice-of-life, mild fantasy, internal conflict, and
    well-sorted-out drama on top of having a respectable amount of OST backing
    up is quite a lot to offer for something of this relatively small scale work
    (can't help that the build-up and transgression in-between was quite
    intolerable though)

    Little introduction is required for this blockbuster of the Visual Novel
    medium. It has basically everything one can demand when it comes to "heavy
    metal" stuff, yet personally, I find the resolution for the endgame lacking
    in satisfying the many ideas and premises raised in the early game. Was a
    dang terrific ride anyhow.

    In the beginning, I never took this VN seriously enough thanks to the
    ludicrous amount of juveniles it has in store. However, the more I got
    involved with this franchise the more it grew on me. Of course, the plot
    itself failed to clear away some distinguished holes (a toll all time-travel
    series must pay), but I think they did a job well done regardless by
    leveraging that foundation to bring forth something rather daring, poignant,
    and wholesome without compromising the main theme of the story. Apart from
    that, another reason why I hold this series in high regard is due to the
    existence of Futaki Kanata, she is just simply out of this world.

      Baldr Sky should be on this list but I've decided that it belongs to my
      discovery of the previous year 2020 since I find it more sensible to
      qualify the time based on when exactly did I started reading it.

    As a bike rider myself, I should be able to relate myself to this anime, and
    while that was true for the most part, they sort of "strayed off" from their
    original path wayyyyy too much as the story hits the 2nd half, which is
    quite a shame.

    Winter can't get any cozier by watching this lukewarm anime filled with a
    very fun cast and tons of Japan's culture references which is neat because I
    get to be entertained and learn something new at the same time (I think).

    Think you have had enough of war drama stuff? Think again, 86 is here to
    revalidate this worn-out topic and bring forth a breath of fresh air that
    keeps your mind occupied and be in awe of cool elements such as a nicely
    assembled cast, intriguing world-building, and A LOT of banger OSTs.
