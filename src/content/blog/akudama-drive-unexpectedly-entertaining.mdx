  <p>
    Taken in a cyberpunk mixing a bit of steampunk (I’d say around 10%) setting,
    Akudama Drive has got to be the most ambitious original work of Fall 2020,
    if not, the entirety of 2020. However, the higher they climb, the bigger the
    fall. Okay, maybe the latter is an exaggeration but frankly, I’m just not
    satisfied with how the 2nd half of the anime played out. Nonetheless,
    overall speaking this series did manage to deliver quite a substantial
    amount of entertainment with a lot of cool substance and rarely seen
    approach in anime as a whole.

    First thing first, world-building, and BAMM, it’s truly a killer. I kid you
    not, it might seem a bit weird at first but as I got invested in the first
    two episodes, this anime knows what it is doing in this regard. From a full
    view shot to constant location transition (probably my favorite part) to the
    whimsical introduction of the cast and A LOT of technical details on-screen,
    combined with the very stylish art and, of course, dope music, man, I would
    be lying to say I was not fired up for such overwhelming premise.

    That being said, I’d have preferred them spending at least one or two
    episodes into exploring and providing a solid background for literally
    everything instead of jumping right onto the heat of the game from the
    get-go, which turns out to backfire in the endgame (will cover this later
    on). Apart from that, the info dump with cartoonish tone can get rather
    abrupt and dumb instead of serving its comedic purpose, but not too much of
    a big deal to me.

    Plot-wise, Akudama Drive started off not too shabby with the straightforward
    and playful nature of things, which I also would have preferred remaining
    consistent till the end of the ride but sadly things got off the rail as
    they hit the halfway checkpoint. To put it in layman’s terms, the main
    problem I have with this anime is how they didn’t take things seriously in
    the beginning but then suddenly chose to switch gear to a more dramatic
    approach that resulted in a confusing and convoluted air at the late-game
    period.

  <p>
    I will still have to give it credit for being aware of the entanglement it
    has got itself into and maybe this was intentional after all since I’ve
    noticed a blend of some Western media like Blade Runner, the Matrix,
    Equilibrium, Mad Max, or in the anime medium which are Ergo Proxy and NGE. I
    might have read too much into this but I wholeheartedly believe that Akudama
    Drive was trying to subvert the audience’s expectation by breaking down
    well-known tropes and form its own path, which didn’t end up well but a
    solid effort regardless.

    On a different note, I don’t enjoy how the show relies too much on plot
    convenience with all-over-the-place expositions that makes things forced or
    even unconvincing (like there was an entire episode full of talking and tons
    of transition that made me go wutttt). I would have not minded this if there
    had been a solid foundation or build-up in the early stage, which again is
    what I’ve mentioned above. Another minor concern is how awkward the power
    scale is in this series because at some point it turned from hype to
    confusing and predictable to whatever lol.

    Moving on to the cast, this is where the big letdown reside but well not
    like I should expect too much out of this given the fact that it is an
    original anime and only has one cour. With the “Akudama” being the central
    theme of the anime, while they did make one hell of an entry, as the story
    progresses I failed to find anything refreshing about them nor decent
    development because let’s get real, the only distinguishing feature they
    have is their catchphrase like “eat sh*t” which also grow very dull over
    time.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  <p>
    If anything, some of them have fitting conclusions that resonate pretty well
    with the story. Yet again, the lack of build-up and rushed manner in the
    climax failed to make me identify with them in many ways, thus greatly
    mitigate the impact it had on me.

    On the other hand, the “antagonist” of this anime is pretty much wasted.
    Much as I tried, I could only get one good thing out of this aspect, the
    rest is just there for plot’s sake and even got trashed very badly in some
    scenarios (glaring at a certain short-hair girl). On top of that, the
    “twist” near the end that turned the table on the grand scheme of things was
    badly handled if I have to be honest.

    Despite falling behind with plot and story, what truly makes Akudama Drive a
    ride to remember is the astonishing animation and direction that obliterate
    any doubt you’ve ever had about Studio Pierrot (urgh, I know that staff
    varies in every anime but whatever).

    What can I say, style point is a +200 or more depending on how you view it
    but for real, the neon color usage is just way too awesome that goes super
    well with the funky music. The selling point in this regard to me is how
    they actually managed to nail the atmosphere befitting that of a futuristic
    and semi post-apocalyptic setting.

    Last but not least, the action sequence is simply a feast for the eye. I
    don’t know about you but I got hyped really fast in the early stage (which
    sadly didn’t last long) where everyone in this anime was going rampage. Some
    of the climaxes were really well done, to say the least, from lighting to
    camera angle, and the closed-up shots to emphasize the characters’
    expressions.

    Regarding sound, I must say they didn’t hold any punch to match the nature
    of this anime. The sick OP and ED are one thing but the BGMs are real treats
    to me because they just go so well with the atmosphere and story at some
    point. A prime example of this would be the final episode where everything
    comes together. Additionally, the seiyuu also did their best to convey the
    characters’ feelings in the most honest way possible so that is also a plus.

  <p>
    To wrap this up, Akudama Drive is arguably the most surprising entry of 2020
    with pretty solid production value. Even though I complain a lot about the
    main contents of this anime, I’m still gonna give it that how bold it was to
    set the bar so high while remaining unwavering toward the finish line. It
    sure has serious problems regarding plots and characters, but for an anime
    that doesn’t rely on any source material (though it is still influenced by
    some famous fictional works mentioned above) to come out in this modern
    time, I sure as hell was entertained and highly recommend this for people
    looking for something refreshing and daring.
