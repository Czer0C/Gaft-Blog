    As a regular consumer of media featuring themes of robots or anything
    related to AI in general, I must say Vivy Flourite took me by surprise
    through the sheer amount of ballsiness it has in store. I mean, from a
    logical perspective, there sure as hell are a ton of problems regarding plot
    coherency.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the trade-off here is that it has managed to set the bar so high to
    the point that
    <em>
      <strong> I was virtually forced to overlook</strong>
    </em>
    all of the implausible developments throughout the show and be occupied by
    the thematic value and atmospheric deliverables that it offers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Episode 4</strong>, in particular, truly is the one shining example
    of what embodies a "kino" anime episode, for it has:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Great pacing</li>
    <li>Superb character interaction and development (Vivy ðŸ˜”)</li>
  </ul>

      (AAAAAAA), further accentuated the dramatic overtone which has already
      engulfed the entire episode from the start

    While Vivy is no doubt the best character of this anime so far (though I
    doubt there'll be any newcomers in later episodes that can topple her), the
    Estella/Elizabeth sisters <strong>stomped </strong>this episode for me.

    For one thing, the theme presented in this episode isn't anything new nor
    groundbreaking.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, I have to give it to the creator for going out of their way to{" "}
    <strong>experiment </strong>rarely seen concepts in anime, let alone in this
    time and age where all we get every season is Isekai and light novel
    adaptations (not to trash on them but I just prefer{" "}
    <strong>original </strong>anime in general).

    Anyhow, the main idea behind Estella and Elizabeth might seem trivial on the
    surface but, personally, I find it to be very thought-provoking in the
    setting of Vivy Flourite.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sure, robots are made with a <strong>programmatic purpose</strong> set in
    stone, nothing more, nothing less.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>But what if there's something else behind that?</em>

    It might sound like hack and shit because, well, no way AI can have a mind
    of their own, right? Still, I beg to differ, as it's not far-fetched for
    them to make "<strong>question</strong>", or at the least,{" "}
    <strong>re-validate</strong> their original purpose, which is to{" "}
    <strong>have a mission</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is exactly when Elizabeth the<strong> "defective"</strong> comes to
    shine after crawling out of the scrapyard which had long severed her from
    true freedom.
  </p>

      They nailed this scene by distorting her voice which added up a lot to her
      determination
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The way she bent the <strong>amendment </strong>for robots to her own{" "}
    <strong>"belief"</strong> is just simply mind-blowing and a daring move from
    the creator.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, it gives her the adequate substance to
    <em>
      {" "}
      blur the line between a boring/disposable villain to a compelling tragic anti-hero
      of the story.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    As for Estella, what can I say apart from being too pure for this mildly
    depressing series?
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  <p>
    I mean, she might haven't done much throughout this arc, but I legit can't
    get enough of her interaction with the other sisters, especially Vivy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way she stood firm to her "<strong>ideal</strong>" and sent her sister
    off without hesitation just simply radiates that strong sisterhood energy,
    which is also a very rarely seen trope in anime.

  <p>
    In the end, what really hits home here is the fact that both Estella and
    Elizabeth got to do the things that they <strong>wanted to do.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, humanizing AI or robots is a rather overused trope but regardless,
    it's just indescribably melancholic to see them taking off the stage like
    that.

    One can argue that the{" "}

    sisters might render them nothing more than plot devices for the story,
    <em> but I digress.</em>

    <strong>Not </strong>everything necessarily needs to be laid out in front of
    our screen to have actual meaning. With the excellent use of{" "}
    <strong>eye </strong>and <strong>facial </strong>expression or even a simple{" "}
    <strong>gesture</strong>, much can be deciphered regarding certain
    characters as the story continues.

    Apart from that, there're always <strong>callbacks </strong>from previous
    scenes at pivotal moments to give them actual purpose and meaning, which is
    a major plus to me since I hate random throwback and pointless build-up the
    most.

    It still gives goosebumps when I think about what happened at the endgame of
    this episode.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though everything accelerated at pretty ridiculous pacing, I could not
    help but feel overwhelmed by the constant shower of well-handled expositions
    and revelations, which all add up to the grand scheme of things.
  </p>
  <p>
    And god f***ing dammit, I gotta get all of the OST and BGM after all of them
    are released because I swear I kept getting chills from even just a casual
    chatting scene lel.
