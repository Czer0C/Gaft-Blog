      <b>[MAJOR SPOILERS]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    As a heads-up, this is a pretty long post with lots of rambling, and of
    course, there will be spoilers so proceed with cautions. I will be talking
    about the heroines and a bit of side female characters. Frankly, Aokana
    kinda left me with mixed feelings so I wanted to make a more proper thread
    about it, but for now, I can just settle for something like this.

    <h2>
      <b>The Heroines</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Misaki is definitely the most fleshed-out <strong>heroine</strong>. She
    basically went through various transitions of emotion and developments that
    kept me in awe many times.

    The best moment of the VN is when she was revealed to be the ‚Äúboy‚Äù who
    traumatized Mayasa, I mean, the thematic buildup, the atmosphere, and music,
    and CG, BOI, that‚Äôs when it all peaked lmao (they really really should have
    used that scene as a confession goddammit).

    Her route also has the best theme IMO, because it musters up some negative
    sides of competition which at first glance doesn‚Äôt seem to fit the
    light-hearted nature of Aokana (for real I got tons of Yandere vibe during
    some scenes) but to me, it‚Äôs a bold and refreshing approach to make the
    story more captivating.

    Asuka is runner up, to tell the truth, I don‚Äôt like the kind of air-head
    character and so, in the beginning, I was kinda annoyed by her, but over
    time she slowly grew on me and there were even some fascinating moments from
    her that took my breath away.

    But well, that‚Äôs the thing, she kinda relies on the plot too much, and is
    too perfect of a character to the point of making me feel like it‚Äôs dull at
    some point, but since it‚Äôs well handled so I ranked her quite close to
    Misaki.

    Mashiro and Rika are fine as heroines, they have their own moments, but
    unfortunately, they‚Äôre destined to be overshadowed by the powerhouse Misaki
    and Asuka so well.

  <p>
    Anyway, that was just <strong>heroine </strong>ranking, if we count the
    remaining female character as well, my personal favorite girl is Inui Saki
    hand down (<em>honorable mention</em> being Satouin), though there are
    actually quite a lot of mixed feelings I have about her.

    When Saki was introduced, I was fanboying like crazy, because it was so much
    hype boi, her eyes, her posture, her ‚Äúaura‚Äù, all so fucking blended so well
    together that made me feel like I was literally giving in to her (not in an
    M way of course lel). I had lots of hope that‚Äôd be tons of ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moments
    with her. And‚Ä¶I was right‚Ä¶and wrong at the same time.

    I mean in terms of FC fights, it was pure gasm, she didn‚Äôt disappoint me one
    bit, even though she took 2 Ls but that was inevitable for going against
    main characters, but the overall result is that she delivered those sick ass
    moves and tons of hype, fuck, just her glare alone is enough to make me go
    ape shit, let alone that Avgraine or whatever the fuck that is, which was
    fucking fire.

    That being said, it‚Äôs just not enough to do her character justice. It feels
    like she hasn‚Äôt received enough care and development that she truly
    deserves, I mean even Satouin is better than her in that regard.

    There was just too little screen time for Saki, her motive needs to be even
    further polished, just the deal with Irina alone doesn‚Äôt feel quite enough.
    While I‚Äôve got the full picture of her story, it wasn‚Äôt presented in a
    proper enough manner.

  <p>
    From how I see it, ever since childhood Saki just wants to have fun, but due
    to her introvert nature and ‚Äúcold‚Äù appearance, almost nobody gives a fuck
    about her, till Irina showed up. ‚ÄúWait doesn‚Äôt this contradict the whole
    mumble-jumble ‚Äòtrue FC‚Äô that they been rambling about?‚Äù is what you may be
    thinking, well, yes and no.

    Saki truly wants to have fun, but the reason why she keeps forcing everyone
    into submission is to please Irina. ‚ÄúThen why just Irina‚Äù? Well, this points
    back to the previous fact about how she‚Äôs always left alone because nobody
    understands her.

    So that‚Äôs it, she‚Äôs like a lonely king sitting on the top of the summit, not
    because she looks down on them, but because she‚Äôs too good. It‚Äôs quite sad
    for her when I think about it, also explains her always acting cold all the
    time, people <strong>fear </strong>what they{" "}
    <strong>don‚Äôt understand</strong>, so she‚Äôs always left alone, but the truth
    is that this little girl just wants to have fun like many other people out
    there.

    This is exactly how Asuka the carefree was able to ‚Äútame‚Äù Saki. For someone
    who always views her surroundings in a positive light, it makes perfect
    sense how Asuka managed to understand Saki's feelings up there, thus was
    able to connect and give her what she want. a beautiful sportsmanship and
    friendship crafted in the midst of chaos I‚Äôd say.

    In any case, I think the deal with Saki is a really good concept since it
    adds more depth to a seemingly OP character with G.O.A.T material.
    Unfortunately, it was not well executed due to the rushed and limited screen
    time as I mentioned above, making it feel half-assed. Like CMONBRUH, I HAD
    TO SPEND 20 FUCKING HOURS getting through Rika, Mashiro, Misaka, and half of
    Asuka route JUST TO GET A BIT OF of Saki, so you get the idea, while the way
    things went out was good, but it‚Äôs just not good enough to pay back the hype
    and anticipation I held for her.

  <p>
    All and all, I‚Äôm just salty that Saki didn‚Äôt get proper treatment, all
    because, obviously, she‚Äôs just a side character, which is really a shame. I
    would have not been bitching like this had it not been for the producer
    kinda made her introduction a bit too grandiose, and she was also meant to
    be the end-game material, which raised my expectation at the speed of light
    every time I saw her show up in the common route (but there was like 2?
    moments only or so LMAO), and thus not getting the satisfaction that I had
    hoped.

  <p>
    With all that said, overall I still like Saki a hell lot, she‚Äôs still the
    "monarch" of the story to me despite all the setback. The climax and
    semi-ending with her and Asuka having fun and making friends is also a sight
    to behold as well, kinda makes me feel proud that they‚Äôd come this far, to
    be more than just FC players. However, just if, if she had had more focus,
    she might have evolved into something much more extraordinary‚Ä¶
