      <b>Premise</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    What makes an <strong>ideal </strong>life? That question has been wandering
    in my mind for a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    Is it one where I can get anything I want without being bothered by the
    wallet's limit?
  </p>
  <p>
    Is it one where I can have lots of friends to party all day long and pay no
    heed to the daily chore and my parent's rants?
  </p>
  <p>Is it one where I can lead lots of people and have their respect?</p>
  <p>
    Honestly, they all seem too <em>abstract </em>for me. I want something more
    tangible, achievable through a simple method yet coupled with a handful of
    effort.

      <b>Story &amp; World-Building</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    When it comes to slice-of-life anime, many people will usually downright
    assume that the story is <strong>shallow </strong>or having{" "}
    <strong>poor pacing</strong>, .etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I’m not going to argue with that overstatement, Aria is definitely{" "}
    <em>not a mere</em> slice of life show.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can indeed get super <em>slow </em>at some point, but overall, there is
    narration and directing to make up for it, leaving the viewers tempted at
    the highlight moments of a particular episode.

    Influenced by Venice's culture, the author did a splendid job creating the
    post-modern "replica" called <strong>Neo-Venezia</strong>, "sprinkled" with
    some fancy <em>sci-fi elements</em> to spice it up a bit with a futuristic
    vibe mixing surrealism.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      The story isn't just about a group of "cute girls doing cute things" like
      many other slice-of-life series entail, but also about{" "}
      <strong>
        finding the meaning and value of little things that we usually take for
        granted
      </strong>{" "}
      in our everyday life.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Not to mention, the anime itself has a <strong>goal</strong>, a final
    destination to conclude the journey, and this 3rd season, namely
    Origination, carried out that role perfectly.

    <figcaption>Ahhhh, to be young again</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Despite being a manga adaptation (yes, I read the manga first), the anime
    did not fail to surprise me in many ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    To put this into perspective, the producer had managed to create a parallel
    universe to the manga, making the anime feels more <strong>original</strong>
    , as the title suggests.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, they had also preserved the <strong>core value</strong> of
    Aria, which is a remarkable feat given the{" "}
    <em>ill reputation of anime adaptation as a whole</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The episodic format ensures that everything happening within one episode
    would conclude neatly, leaving barely any lingering mysteries or unanswered
    problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, the narration often comes from a particular “main” character of
    their own arc, which gives you a chance to see more refreshing sides of Aria
    as a whole.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-card-hascaption kg-width-wide kg-image-card">

  <p>
    Pacing-wise, it is simply magnificent. Though I admit it can get stupid slow
    at some point, <em>that doesn’t make the anime boring. </em>On the contrary,{" "}
    <strong>it attributes indirectly to one of the show’s advantages</strong>{" "}
    and is, in my opinion, one of the most iconic features when one speaks of
    Aria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apologize for the impending geezer mode, but sometimes, life can be pretty
    much like a <strong>“fast-lane”</strong> where we are persistently bothered
    by all kinds of un-called problems or ordeals.
  </p>
  <p>
    To name a few, deadlines, family affairs, assignments, work, some shocking
    scandal that affects your country, some outrageous crime news that can’t
    help but make you feel distraught about humanity as a whole, .etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>However, that doesn’t mean you should leave it like that.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    If anything, it would not hurt if you
    <strong> sit back, relax, and take it a bit slow</strong> once in a while and
    think back on what we have achieved, what motivated us to reach this far, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the same vein, Aria takes its slow pacing as a stepping stone to weaving
    a unique atmosphere, <strong>freezing time</strong> to deliver the “feels”
    to the audience.

    <h2>
      <b>Characters</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    One of the best things that Aria has at its disposal is the{" "}
    <em>elegantly crafted</em> cast who all serve their part well without being{" "}
    <em>left behind</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned above, the girls, or <strong>Undine</strong>, are on a
    "mission" to <em>unravel the essence of things surrounding them</em>. It
    goes without saying, Hal Film Maker had succeeded in portraying the life of
    3 young girls and their respective seniors in a futuristic yet classic
    setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each has her <strong>catch-phrase</strong> that never grows boring me. Apart
    from that, the daily activities are depicted in such a refined way that{" "}
    <em>I can pretty much relate to them</em>.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      While there is Akari who acts as the protagonist of the show, the other
      "main" characters also got their fair share amount of screen time. What's
      more, occasionally, they even have the opportunity to{" "}
      <strong>"steal"</strong> the protagonist's narrating role, helping to
      widen the series's scale and diversity.
    </p>
  </div>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-card-hascaption kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="https://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/gaftonosh/2021/10/aria-the-origination-07.m4v.00_19_22_11.still001.webp"

      "Grandma" be like{" "}
      <em>"Imma just casually slide in and take over this episode"</em>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    What I also really like about the characters is their “
    <strong>natural</strong>” development,{" "}
    <em>which doesn’t feel forced one bit</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, when an episode reached its climax, everything would play out
    smoothly. The execution felt <strong>quick yet decisive</strong>, thus
    delivered a tremendous impact on me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not to mention, the interactions between the girls are surprisingly a
    refreshing sight to witness. To be more specific, I never thought that “A
    would get along with B since they never talked to each other much” or of the
    sort.
  </p>
  <p>
    My favorite character of the anime is the{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>arrogant and juvenile yet realistic</em>
    </strong>{" "}
    Alice Carroll, not just because of her personality but also how I can relate
    with her. Lastly, she has arguably the most exotic and distinct development
    of all the characters, so yeah, that's a big win for me.

    <h2>
      <b>Animation</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    In terms of animation/presentation, I find this the finest asset that the
    anime has in store.
  </p>
  <p>
    The art style is very “<strong>frugal</strong>” yet fastidiously drawn, not
    without its uniqueness that never ceases to amaze me.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, the <strong>character design</strong> is also a plus for
    this one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oft-times the only thing I care about in this regard is the characters’
    faces alone, nothing else. However, I must give the <strong>outfit </strong>
    design a medal for being so majestic and <strong>pure</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Put bluntly, it fits the concept of Undine and the ataraxy setting
    flawlessly, which in turn emits a striking aura whenever I get to see them
    roll out.
  </p>
  <p>
    The animation is seamlessly done, from{" "}
    <em>facial gestures to the gondola movement</em> and the background misc,
    .etc. In other words, it feels as though everything has become one.

    With all said, there is something much more remarkable in this category,
    which is the sublime <strong>landscape views</strong> that compelled me to
    be wholly astounded whenever they emerged.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      It’s not about how detailed they are drawn but more about the nostalgia
      they withhold within.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Though the breathtaking background is undoubtedly the anime’s primary
    “weapon”, to me, they only serve as a <em>pillar </em>to the core theme of
    the series or, to be more specific, a specific episode.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, the background art isn’t the only thing that was well handled, but
    the visual effects are also carefully done, which dramatically improves the
    mood at the turning point of an episode.

      Some episodes might feel dull and sluggish at first, yet as the moment of

    The camera angle also plays a vital role in <strong>connecting </strong>the

      <b>Sound Design</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Last but not least, although the sound is usually the one element that falls
    behind, or should I say, one that viewers <strong>overlook </strong>since
    they’re too busy paying attention to the other contents of the show, Aria
    doesn’t abandon it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The OP and ED are so chill that <em>they can not suit the show more</em>.
    One charming feature about the former is that it doesn’t have a “fixed”
    animation sequence like many other animes and runs alongside the show (it’s
    more of an <strong>intro</strong> than OP), thus{" "}
    <em>saving me my precious 90 seconds and extra screentime of the show</em>.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      What is also noteworthy about the music is that they don’t sound “cheesy”
      like many “moe” shows use to attract customers, which instantly comes to
      my liking. In addition, background music is played at the right moment,
      adding up to the atmosphere just so to create a profound impression on the
      audience.
    </p>
  </div>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  </figure>
  <p>
    Apart from that, like many other animes, Aria is backed by capable voice
    actors.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s not a stretch to call these people the <strong>“souls”</strong> of the
    characters and one of the many reasons the anime industry prospers. Their
    voice is meant for these girls, from their personalities to the scenarios
    that involve them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, this goes double when it comes to the highlight and dramatic
    parts, which is hard to achieve since they have to <strong>“feel”</strong>{" "}
    the character themselves to able able to bring about such spectacular
    performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m not going to spoil, but it is not my everyday life that I get to see a
    character sing so passionately in an anime that is not about music. For
    real, I was immensely moved by her song in “that” episode. Kudos to the Hal
    Film Maker for going all out on this one.

      <b>Enjoyment</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Watching Aria almost feels like experiencing life itself, the one life that
    I would strive for it. I’ve in fact traveled to a place somewhat similar to
    Aria’s setting and might someday move there if I ever get a chance.
    <br />
    <br />
    To put it in another way, the anime itself is like a “tour” that I take for granted
    at first, but gradually,
    <em>
      the more I emerge myself in, the more I’m attached to it and can’t help
      but crave for more.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This “tour” is an unforgettable ride, like a roller coaster that twists me
    in different shapes of mood and eventually brings me to a gratifying
    destination.

  <p>
    Some moments make me <strong>laugh</strong>, such as when the characters
    acted so silly and naive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some <strong>overwhelmed </strong>me with a strong sense of nostalgia that
    made me pause the show and think for a while before getting back to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some make me feel very <strong>chill </strong>thanks to their awkwardly
    childish, innocent, yet sensible thoughts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some give me <strong>goosebumps </strong>even though I can’t tell how did
    they manage to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some make me <strong>smile </strong>inside myself due to the heart-warming
    atmosphere.

      For me, watching Aria after a hard day from work/study is{" "}
      <strong>
        the best kind of medicine I can ever ask for without much effort
      </strong>
      , can’t explain why, but it’s just pure magic.
      <br />
      <br />
      Initially, it might feel like nothing was happening, but in no time, I’d
      already found myself engulfed in an endless stream of “euphoria” and
      enjoyment that wiped away all the irritating matters I had encountered
      earlier.
      <br />
      <br />I think it’s safe to say the show{" "}
      <strong>knows how to manipulate the viewers into its realm</strong>,
      making me and many other fans wish that it never end, but unfortunately,
      nothing lasts forever.

    <h2>
      <b>Bottom Line</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    The bottom line is, Aria the Origination in particular and the Aria
    franchise, as a whole, is a very thematic series that fantastically
    <strong>
      <em> </em>
    </strong>
    <em>
      depicts the ideal life that we should have while sustaining its top-notch
      production value.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    To be honest, I learned quite a lot from this show, and to
    <strong> enjoy little things</strong> is probably the best lesson that I got.
    On top of that, it also serves as a memento to me that while life can be rough
    sometimes, <strong>never forget to pay heed to its positive side as well.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything comes to an end, and this is one of the most bittersweet
    farewells that I have to accept. Even so, the eternal light continues to
    illuminate upon the Orange Planet.
