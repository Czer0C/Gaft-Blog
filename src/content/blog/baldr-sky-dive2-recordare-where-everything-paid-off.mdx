    Finished the game today. Honestly speaking, I’m not sure how to put this. It
    almost had it, you know, like I’m very close to the edge and all it takes is
    one little push and I might have found myself being drowned in a sea of{" "}
    <em>
      <em>
        <strong>jksdfhsdjfhsdfjsd </strong>
      </em>
    </em>
    feeling. But welp, I guess this is one of the problems with being overhyped over
    something.

      Now, I’m not saying that this VN sucks or anything, it’s great in fact,
      definitely my top 5 for now. I also feel like this is not even the
      creator’s fault as they did an excellent job presenting this work with
      incredible production value.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sure, the overall concept and theme might not be groundbreaking or revolutionary
      but the <strong>dedication</strong> is there and <strong>
        very real
      </strong>, sometimes that’s all it takes for me to appreciate work.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, that's just it.{" "}
      <em>
        The game had reached its peak at some points close to the extreme
        endgame period
      </em>
      , I stopped getting chills and goosebumps from all of the supposed “wowwaaahhhh”
      moments.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    But hey, beggars can’t be choosers. I enjoyed this VN a fucking hell lot
    regardless.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  </figure>
  <p>
    But to get back on track, the best part about this VN is no doubt its
    ambitious world-building and plot integrity. For real, I never realized how
    fun it was to take out a paper and outline the “big picture” after reading
    certain parts of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though they would all be explained later on, I just find taking the
    initiative by conducting an educative guess a very whimsical experience, and
    BSD is the first work that made me do so, so well done here.
  </p>
  <p>
    The routing structure is very cleverly done by the creator to make them{" "}
    <strong>
      actually have a purpose rather than being there just for the sake of being
      there.
    </strong>{" "}
    Although BSD is not the first VN that I’ve read to follow this method, I
    find its approach engaging and very meticulously put, so that’s a big bonus.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a different note, while some people have claimed that the other routes
    more or less serve as fillers, I’d like to strongly disagree because they
    both solve mysteries and raise some questions at the same time
    <strong>,</strong> thus giving the necessary fuel to continue on with the overall
    story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not to mention some of them even carry various underlying themes regarding
    the cyberpunk setting or just simply the meaning of being “alive”, which can
    get very thought-provoking and poignant (
    <strong>Chinatsu route is best in this regard don’t @ me</strong>).
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    That being said, plot convenience can be a drawback in some segments, albeit
    not too big of a deal compared to the grand scheme of things. But man, the
    recurring{" "}
    <strong>raep pattern is just downright annoying and :schleep: lmao.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than that, the <strong>pacing </strong>is most likely the biggest
    obstacle to those who have low tolerance on SoL, though I myself was rather
    irritated by the “switching” back and forth between flashback and presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cast, in general, is nicely put, I guess. I mean apart from, according
    to Rain,{" "}
    <em>
      <em>
        <strong>“A scumbag lowlife piece of unrecyclable trash”</strong>
      </em>
    </em>{" "}
    Gilbert, and Anan (who’s pretty much fodder anyway) I don’t think I hate
    anyone or at least find them repulsive.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, I have failed to find anyone that is capable of{" "}
    <em>creating a profound impact</em> on me, which is quite a shame given the
    great potentials of this VN as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kou is one of a few VN protagonists that I actually enjoy, can be dense when
    it comes to dealing with girls, but when situations demand he’s more capable
    than he looks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The side cast is pretty solid, <strong>Fenrir </strong>gang is one thing but
    holy shiet <strong>Seira </strong>is an <strong>absolute troll</strong> (
    <em>
      <em>and motherly figure</em>
    </em>
    ) and I like it. Would be nice to know more about them though but at least they’re
    not entirely shallow, unlike most stories.

    And now for the <s>waifu war</s> heroines discussion, honestly,{" "}
    <em>
      <em>I just can’t decide</em>
    </em>{" "}
    between Chinatsu and Sora. At least I think I can safely say, for the first
    time ever too, that there’s no best girl to me in this VN.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the beginning, I actually favored Chinatsu a bit but{" "}
    <strong>only as a character</strong> because she has so many great themes
    that are my favorite combined with the fucking amazing bad ending (
    <strong>Departure</strong>) on top of a pretty non-forced romance
    progression{" "}
    <em>
      <em>
        <strong>(If we also count pre Gray Christmas).</strong>
      </em>
    </em>

    <figcaption>Awwwww</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    But then as I got closer to the endgame, Sora started to grow on me more,
    and frankly, while I personally find her to be just a bit above average as
    gf material (mostly regarding personalities), her story and the plot that
    revolves around her is just{" "}
    <em>
      <em>
        <strong>aaaaaaAAAAA</strong>
      </em>
    </em>
    . So damn, I felt like I hit a wall.

    <figcaption>Guhhhhh</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    I mean, both girls have their pros and cons, while most people would prefer
    Sora and even despite Chinatsu for sure because of what happened in her
    route (I already wrote an{" "}
    <a href="https://vndb.org/t13555.4" rel="noopener">
      essay defending her)
    </a>
    , but to me, context matters, and I’ve come to a conclusion that both are fit
    to be Kou’s gf, so yeah, I can’t pick who’s the best girl. If anything though,
    their rivalry can be intriguing, given how it can randomly switch between ridiculous
    to hilarious and even comfy to witness.

  <p>
    Rain is a bit below these 2 to me. She’s loyal and the best support we can
    ever ask for but that’s about it. I feel like there’re more potentials to
    her character rather than just merely clinging to Kou but whatever.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rest of the heroine cast is fine at most, though it seems there’s a lot
    of hate on Nanoha which is understandable but I thought it made sense how
    she was meant that way so I don’t really mind her behavior tbh.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aki and Makoto are in a realm where, urgh, I’d rather not touch but as
    characters they’re fine. Yet again, the chemistry/rivalry between the
    heroines, in general, is not entirely flat and can lighten up the mood in
    many ways, which is also a good thing.

    Gameplay-wise, man,{" "}
    <strong>the RPG sure as hell needs some serious renovating</strong>. I mean
    the fighting mechanism is not bad, but
    <em>
      {" "}
      do they have to cram a ton of random battles in between a section of an important
      conversation or some sort?
    </em>
    {
      "I lost count of how many times I wanna hit the keyboard because of the interruption lmao."
    }
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyhow, it would be nice if we can have a{" "}
    <strong>free mode to select other characters’ Simulacrums</strong> but not a
    big deal.

    Technical-wise, the CGs are neat with some extremely dope shots to either
    highlight the climax, dramatic values or simply for aesthetic purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, the character design can be invested more tbh because their
    outfits can be very terrible (Chinatsu why lmao), but at least Sora got a
    sick one in the endgame (gotta love the lighting in this shot boi).

    Sound and music are a treat. I mean whenever the 2 OPs play during a fight
    scene I just simply lost my shit. The BGM on the other hand just hit right
    at the feel, “Rainy Comfort” is probably my fav in this regard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from that they also got some great combat themes too, the one for the
    cultist Dominion unexpectedly got me fired up the most other than the 2 OPs.

    If there’s anything to complain about, yep,{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>the menu still sucks</strong>
    </em>
    . They should have picked a less distracting design, color scheme, and positioning
    instead of cramming up everything in a single tab together but meh whatever,
    at least there are fun features like the profile chart that can be fun to goof
    around.

    Overall, I think Baldr Sky was a wonderful ride for me. Though it is not the
    best thing I’ve seen, it sure as hell got me deeply invested at some points,
    and actually provided a solid gameplay experience despite the flaws
    mentioned above (because hey{" "}

    is fun).
