    Blassreiter overall is a rather very ambitious series. Its scale drastically
    increased after 1/3 of the course and didn’t show any sign of stopping its
    momentum in expanding the world-building that is also accompanied by a very
    diverse cast. Normally, that’s a very rare sight to see in anime as a whole
    and should be welcomed and appreciated, but as they said, don’t bite off
    more than one can chew, Blassreiter simply fell for that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The recurring theme in this anime is probably the meaning and value of life,
    which is something I always enjoy regardless of the medium. Blassreiter
    almost succeeded in delivering it, but sadly for being too greedy, it made a
    whole mess on itself as the story progressed. The drama, in particular,
    feels very forced on many occasions, like they just threw in some sad and
    tragedy shit just to explain a character’s motive then QUICKLY snapped back
    to the current timeline, like wut bruh, at least treat it with care.
  </p>
  <p>
    And really, they sure like to abuse the “reality is harsh” thingy, to the
    point that I can basically tell what the next flashback of a character is
    before it even showed up lmao. Not to mention that the whole deal with those
    tragedies didn’t convince me at all, I think it’s too absurd and convenient
    in fact. However, some moments were really well handled that I almost
    overlooked the flaws behind it, like when Joseph was made to falsely confess
    himself before the rich twat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plot-wise, to be frank, there are lots of dumb moments in the course of 24
    episodes that basically confused me in many ways possible (the last episode,
    especially the endgame battle, is no exception LOL). That said, the more I
    watched the more comical it got and eventually I just didn’t give a fuck
    about the logical reasoning behind them anymore, it’s some sort of a “so bad
    that it’s good” thingy. While world-building is pretty interesting, there’re
    still quite some loose ends that haven’t been resolved in the end, it felt
    rushed to be more precise. That and relying too much on backstory is not
    really a good thing, but can be overlooked since it helped in building up a
    solid cast.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there’s one thing that I can’t really tolerate then it’s the awkward
    pacing. Some scenes were really well made, but some just made me feel like
    “WTF” for a bazillion times LOL. Actually, I think I can somewhat agree with
    a comment above saying the script was written on an episode basis, so
    there’s no clear planning in the first place which explains the really
    messed up pacing LOL.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cast is probably the most decent thing about this anime. Even though
    there’re tons of flaws out there regarding execution, planning and, well,
    like my little rant above pointed out, cohesion, I still enjoyed seeing the
    characters going out of their way to fuck shit up while not without having
    some tragic moments.
  </p>
  <p>
    We got Al who went out like a G, my nibba Shido who fought till the very end
    like a boss, Joseph a cool looking badass motherfucker, Amanda a hot damn
    woman with a calm and very fair judgemental mind that is extremely rare in
    anime, even Gerd who got fucked over by almost everyone in the show really
    got some major highlight that managed to impress me, and many more that I
    can’t really list out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though this is quite a debatable element, I don’t think we have had that
    many anime that has the balls to kill off its characters in such a decisive
    manner. Whether it’s a good thing or not is all up to the execution and
    context behind that act, but disregarding those factors, not being hesitant
    in doing that is definitely a plus in my book.
  </p>
  <p>
    And lastly, while there are tons of characters running amok, the creators
    did try their best to justify their actions, having more care to side
    characters than ordinary anime would do, which is also a good thing no
    matter how you look at it. It doesn’t matter if their motives are good or
    bad, as long as they have ONE, it easily increase their worth by ten-fold
    compared to generic anime that never give a fuck about supporting
    characters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the art, LOL, I don’t really know what to say about it. The CGI looks
    really EHHHHH to me, I know it’s not really a modern anime but I just can’t
    stop laughing at how funny it looks tbh. If anything though, the design is
    lit. Lots of badass-looking Amalgon and tons of fancy military vehicles that
    rarely seen in action anime, so yeah that might somewhat compensate the
    wonky CGI.
  </p>
  <p>
    Character design is also a plus, I like them overall, especially, *sigh*,
    SNOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. Why it has to be her of all
    the……okay I’m gonna stop. But really though, the Germany theme is really a
    fresh sight to my eyes, glad to see something cool after countless high
    school setting shit lmao.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a side note, I know it is a bit out of place but Imma do it anyway,
    here’s my waifu (not character) ranking in Blassreiter:
  </p>
  <p>Snow &gt;= Pre-apoc Sasha (the blonde version) &gt; Amanda &gt;= Lene.</p>
  <p>
    In any case, with this you should be able to see why I was so pissed at what
    they did in episode 19.
  </p>
  <p>
    And finally, sound, can’t comment much on this since nothing really stands
    out to me. It’s not horrible either, but just meh. However, I do find the ED
    “Wish for the star” really fitting to the context of the story and the
    animation sequence for it was on solid as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, Blassreiter was definitely an unforgettable experience for
    me. Sure it is not perfect. Sure it feels stupid at some point. But it sure
    managed to leave behind quite an aftertaste for me. With just a simple theme
    revolving around the meaning life and a serious tone accompanied by a
    likable cast, this anime really worth getting more attention and everyone
    should not cast it away just because of a relatively low mean score.
