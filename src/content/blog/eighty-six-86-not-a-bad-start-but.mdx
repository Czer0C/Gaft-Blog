    At the first glance, Eighty-Six appears to be just another hastily issued LN
    adaptation, the like of which you get to see a lot in recent years.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, that expectation of mine quickly got subverted and somehow I
    managed not to drop this show after 3 episodes, a common practice I’ve been
    following a lot as of late{" "}
    <em>
      <em>for many reasons</em>
    </em>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    That is not to say I have no problem with this anime. Heck, in fact, I have
    a ton to talk about if that was the main focus of this post. But for
    simplicity’s sake (and with my schedule not doing so well rn), Imma just
    say, as cliche as this has been going, this anime has a lot of potentials to
    rise up to the rank of being something, but trying too hard does not always
    guarantee a spectacular result.

    First off, world-building is solid so far, but the process, in general,
    didn’t go quite as smoothly. For once, they didn’t handle the prelude to the
    story well enough. Given how wonky the exposition can get at some point, I
    was totally :schleeping: at the premise of this anime (or Episode 1 in
    short).
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, as soon as everything starts to take shape, my enjoyment
    for this anime also responds in kind.

    I mean yeah, the political affairs and themes in Eighty-Six are nothing new,
    they are actually quite common once you’ve spent a fair amount of time in
    entertainment in general but regardless, I’d say they don’t feel so “
    <strong>dry</strong>” at the very least, whether it be a long-ass
    conversation or some typical propaganda lecture scene.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe they just go too well with the setting, or maybe they really do treat
    these concepts with care. And while it’s still a bit early to judge, I doubt
    that I’m going to have any issue with them in a while.

    Next up, the action in this anime can be quite entertaining. I would not go
    as far as saying that it has top-tier execution but I sure as hell got fired
    up for a bit as the heat of the show continues to rise. If anything though,
    I can’t say that I like how they use the music in tandem with the intricate
    fight sequence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not saying that the sound design is bad but just simply{" "}
    <em>
      <em>misused </em>
    </em>
    with
    <em>
      <em> wrong timing</em>
    </em>
    . Like they’re in a middle of an intense battle with lots of talking and shouting
    but they just be like
    <em>
      {" "}
      “IMMA DROP THIS TRACK RIGHT HERE TO OVERLAP WITH EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE WHY
      NOT”
    </em>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyhow the <strong>ED </strong>is really rocking though, looking forward to
    the full version.

    Lastly, the cast and plots are where things start to take a few bumps to me.
    How do I put this? I generally have no issue with the characters, and I do
    acknowledge what the creator is trying to achieve, by giving them a moment
    of build-up before “shit happens”.

    It’s a pretty classical approach yet effective regardless of era, but only
    with the right execution, and sadly Eighty-Six could not keep up with the
    latter. Episode Three is probably one of those “oh shit” kinda development
    you normally get to see in any kind of story, but I don’t know, it felt
    really forced at the end and the flow just kept getting fluctuating over and
    over again due to the constant abrupt transitions.

    If there’s anything that was done right then I guess it has gotta be the
    double perspective of a single scene (episode 3), which sadly got
    overshadowed by that awkward ending.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like, they managed to craft such subtle high-intensity atmosphere from a
    seemingly casual conversation, by showing us{" "}
    <strong>two different sides</strong> it just easily makes for a clear and
    vivid view of the grand scheme of things, for this introductory section,
    which is something that always got on my soft side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from that, the way the character expressions, eye movements, and
    subtle gestures were handled are spot on.

    So the bottom line is, Eighty-Six is definitely one of the more intriguing
    anime adaptations out there in Spring 2021, and while it does present itself
    with a lot of cool and nice ideas/concepts, I cannot say for sure the
    direction of the series is heading toward the path that’s to my liking (
    <em>
      <em>
        <strong>mostly due to the ending of episode 3</strong>
      </em>
    </em>
    ).
  </p>
  <p>
    But what do you know, like I mentioned above it’s still too early to judge,
    and I just want to make a quick first-impression post, maybe at the end of
    the season I’m going to take a fat L and be forced to reconsider my opinion{" "}
    <s>and scrap this post</s> but for now, I just have a lot of mixed feeling
    for this anime. <s>Oh well, at least they have solid waifu materials.</s>
