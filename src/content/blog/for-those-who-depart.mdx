    The connection between Mitsurugi Meiya and Tsukuyomi Mana is arguably one of
    the most delicate things in Muv-Luv. While on paper, it is your typical
    master-servant trope, but as the story progresses, there is more to this
    than meets the eye. I’d say their relationship is something that falls
    between the line of sisters and mother-daughter. Neither of them chose this
    path, yet they continue to strive in life.

    Mana poured all her heart and soul into guiding Meiya down the path of{" "}
    <strong>light</strong>, which ironically is part of the procedure to create
    a perfect body double, aka <strong>shadow</strong>, for Yuuhi, whose role is
    to “illuminate” all of Japan as her name suggests. Though both of them were
    fully aware of the grim future lying ahead, they pressed on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Never displayed grief and the likes on the surface, Mana is a legit hardened
    soldier in every way. Nonetheless, deep inside, she’s always in a great
    conflict with herself. This endeavor might be part of her duty as a member
    of the Shogunate, but the feeling and emotion that she put into are real,
    just for Meiya, and Meiya alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, nothing lasts forever. A bird kept in a cage is no bird. It was
    Meiya’s destiny to go out there and find herself. Half of her life was
    indeed nothing more than living as a political hostage. Nonetheless, Meiya
    always held her head high and spared no effort in seeking out a meaning for
    her life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore it was incredibly cathartic to see Mana sending Meiya off to the
    path of her own. The atmosphere was so majestic, heroic, and tragic at the
    same time. Having one last warming conversation was too much of a luxury for
    these women of war. The two of them had spent far too much time together to
    get sentimental in such a dire time. Hence, having known full well of that
    fact, a single nod was all it took for them to bid each other farewell.

    Such is the world of Muv-Luv Alternative. Such is the world where people
    take drastic action instead of making fancy speeches. That said, while they
    might have appeared to accept this outcome, let’s all be honest here, none
    of them deserve any of that harsh reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yep, this is cliche. The same kind of story that had been told over and over
    again, heroes going to war and die fighting for their loved ones, nothing
    new, nothing special. Nonetheless, under the setting of this universe,
    especially with how these two amazing women had been portrayed and
    foreshadowed in Extra, the painting depicting them in Alternative is just
    that spectacular.
  </p>
  <p>
    IMO this is also one of the <strong>“true love”</strong> that Kouki was
    trying to convey to readers throughout the story. There are certainly more
    coherent ways to define that term. However, the bond between Mana and Meiya
    just resonates with me the most, thanks to the subtle build-up and
    conclusion.
