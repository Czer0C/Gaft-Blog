    <h3>
      <b>[SPOILERS FOR LITTLE BUSTERS]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    I must say that I initially thought of Kanata as a waifu material and
    nothing else. Inexplicably, the more time I spent on LB, the more I got to
    appreciate her as a <strong>character</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't get me wrong, the rest of the cast is solid. Rin, Haruka, and
    Kurugaya, in particular, are just something. I don't think I've grown to
    dislike any of them throughout the ride{" "}
    <strong>(except the trash ass Futakis and Saigusas main house)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All said and done, <em>I am inclined to believe</em> that Kanata is
    doubtlessly<strong> </strong>a cut or two above her peers for several
    reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's natural for people to hold contempt against Kanata. After all, even I
    could not evade incurring a significant amount of annoyance and disgust
    toward her at some point in the story.
  </p>
  <p>But in the end, it all paid off.</p>
  <p>
    There's just <strong>so much </strong>going under the hood for Kanata that
    she keeps blowing my mind the more I think about her.

  <p>
    So yes, brace yourself for another fanboying section of mine over a certain
    someone.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I don't mean to brag</em>, but I have spent roughly{" "}
    <strong>60hrs</strong> on the VN and half as much for its anime adaptation
    (fr). Therefore, I think my feeling for Kanata is justified.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>The Grim Past</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>Let's go back in time for a bit.</p>
  <p>
    You know the drill, it's the same old having absurd family custom{" "}
    <em>(Japan sure like this kind of thing huh)</em>, and Kanata was made to
    decide between continuing this atrocious farce and switching place with her
    sister.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given her <em>constant rambling about her sister's love</em>, it's
    understandable to call Kanata a hypocrite for not choosing what was best for
    her sister.
  </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, there's more to this than meets the eye.</p>
  <p>
    Firstly, Kanata was only at <strong>elementary</strong>; hence, she couldn't
    possibly develop rational thinking or steel herself against the thought of{" "}
    <em>taking all of the abuse</em> Haruka had been enduring.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not to mention, by the time of the proposition, Kanata had experienced
    first-hand the Futakis' <strong>training method</strong> for their
    successors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Honestly, I find it difficult to comprehend how one would blame Kanata in
    such abysmal conditions.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-08-08-10_06_35-Greenshot.webp"
      alt=""
      loading="lazy"
      height={1080}
      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Moreover, what guarantee is there that Haruka will <strong>avoid</strong>{" "}
    getting any ill-treatments had she replaced Kanata since facts remain that
    she <em>almost always lost</em> against her older sister in every
    competition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Futakis set an immoderately high standard for their public image. To be
    worthy of inheriting the family's mantle, one must be well-versed at{" "}
    <em>everything</em>, which is a responsibility befitting the elder of the
    twin alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    To put it in layman's terms,{" "}
    <strong>I don't think much would have changed</strong> had Kanata decided to
    accept the deal. Not that it clears away her guilt, but again, she was just
    a kid at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together with the amount of fatigue, expectations, and physical pain that
    had been weighing on her, Kanata was at a <strong>death's end</strong>,
    unable to make the <em>"right"</em> call for her sister's well-being.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2 id="hope-and-despair">
      <b>Hope and Despair</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Despite the <em>"bad blood" propaganda</em>, being told to shun, trample,
    and bully Haruka intensely, Kanata had <strong>never given up </strong>her
    soul while assuming this distasteful role.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, she proceeded to hatch a plan, a <em>dream</em> of her own.
  </p>
  <p>
    She yearned for a day to come that Haruka and herself would be free and have
    an ordinary, <strong>fully functional family</strong> with their{" "}
    <em>parents</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, Kanata was taking the long shot by feigning obedience in
    tandem with looking after her sister from the shadow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ironically, as the twins' combined first name suggests (
    <strong>Haruka Kanata - Far Away</strong>), fate seemed to have entangled
    them in a spiral of sorrow.
  </p>
  <p>
    As every day passed by, their bond <strong>deteriorated</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before long, unbeknownst to them,{" "}
    <em>the rivalry had already crossed the line of being mere competition.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Notwithstanding, this was just the beginning of the dismal period of the
    twins.

    On the one hand, Haruka went complete <em>berserk</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her cheerful, noisy facade is but a <em>self-defense</em> mechanism that
    helped her make it through the days.
  </p>
  <p>
    In reality, the drawn-out injustice inflicted upon Haruka had taken a
    tremendous toll on her mind. She could no longer differentiate her sister
    from <strong>"them."</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    As for Kanata, her daily grind threshold had far exceeded what should be
    plausible for a normal human being to handle.
  </p>
  <p>
    They didn't call her a <strong>doll</strong> for no reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    She "existed" solely to answer people's demands without having a chance to
    decide anything for herself.
  </p>
  <p>In essence, her future was "stolen."</p>

    Haruka (<strong>pre</strong>-Refrain) often remarked that Kanata deserves to

    To most teens, a day at school is like any ordinary day. But for these two,
    it's <strong>war</strong>, a war that happens on all fronts. Be it physical
    contact, indirect, or mind game, they went all out against each other{" "}
    <em>as if their lives depend on it.</em>

    Kanata once said <em>happiness and misery are to complement each other</em>.
    Though I still object to this notion, it's basically inevitable from the
    context of her and Haruka's story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Haruka would not stop hating her older sister to have a{" "}
    <strong>purpose</strong> in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the same vein, Kanata would uphold the title of the necessary evil as
    part of the deal with the adults and an effort to keep Haruka's spirit away
    from being <strong>extinguished</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>It's a vicious cycle.</p>

  <p>
    In hindsight, Haruka <strong>did remember</strong> the vow. She even craved
    to see her sister's smile again, as showcased in her POV featuring Kud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, hatred had <strong>seduced</strong> her mind and, as a
    result, ridden Haruka of any wishful thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nonetheless,{" "}
    <em>this is a vital key point that would resurface later on</em>.

    As things stand, one can argue why Kanata didn't spill the bean out from the
    get-go. Why bother dragging this out and overcomplicating the situation even
    further.
  </p>
  <p>
    For one thing, Kanata had got{" "}
    <strong>
      her hands tied<em> </em>by the main family's crooked satisfaction
    </strong>
    , coupled with the <em>pressure of helping her parents </em>(revealed in her
    route).
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, the ridiculous<strong> spy network</strong> that had taken
    root in her school would <em>deny Kanata a favorable position </em>to set
    things clear with Haruka.

  <p>It's no strange sight to see Kanata making wild claims like these.</p>
  <p>
    One of the most disturbing things about her is probably the tendency to
    attract negativity to <em>repent for her past sins</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I get where that came from, and while it does make me feel bad for Kanata a
    great lot, I must admit that her mindset is too <strong>extreme</strong>,
    and that can even come up as rude to those surrounding her.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of extreme, why was Kanata so dead set on the idea that trying to
    "save" someone means appearing as a hero/god to them? Riki briefly stated
    that he wanted to help Haruka out of his desire to be a savior.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides, feeling pity for someone can result in unwanted collateral damage,
    like{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>that fateful cooking contest</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    between the sisters.

  </div>
  <p>
    In a sense, Kanata was being an <strong>overprotective</strong> big sis.
  </p>
  <p>
    From her standpoint, everything in life <strong>came at a cost</strong>, and
    to offer help out of free will should not belong to the realm of
    practicality.
  </p>
  <p>
    She didn't trust anyone, and she wouldn't tolerate any attempt of gaining
    merit from saving her sister, for it holds the potential of making things{" "}
    <strong>way worse</strong> than they are right now.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  </figure>
  <p>
    Other than that, I think Kanata was a firm believer in the notion that their
    circumstance was <strong>beyond salvation</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mess they had got themselves into, plus the looming threat known as the
    Futakis - Saigusas main house had led her to conclude that{" "}
    <em>no amount of aid could ever be enough </em>to save them.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, a textbook example of abandoning all hope and resorting to{" "}
    <strong>co-dependency</strong>, or something like that.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  <p>
    On another note, I could be reading too much into this, but Kanata was most
    likely fixated on the idea that she <em>had no right</em> to embrace any of
    the good things in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think about it; she never got a chance to partake in what{" "}
    <em>normal teenagers </em>would do or make any friends. A life so tedious
    and colorless where orders and etiquette are all she knew.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Yet, she wasn't bothered by that.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything and everyone else mattered little, so long as Haruka is safe and
    sound, or at least alive, Kanata would do anything, even if it means,
    according to her own words, becoming the <strong>lowest of the low</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As stated earlier in the <a href="#hope-and-despair">despair</a> section,
    Kanata had gone fully <strong>emotionless</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her mind became numb and immune to all kinds of insult, humiliation, and the
    likes, to the point that she would casually accept any harsh words thrown at
    her like they're nothing.

  <p>IMO this is the one element that defines Kanata as a character.</p>
  <p>
    During the fierce conflict against Haruka, Kanata bit the bullet and{" "}
    <strong>endured everything</strong> as a way to "protect" her sister.

    First off, in this iconic moment of the twins, a subtle{" "}
    <em>irregularity</em> made its appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Haruka, her sentiment was <strong>real</strong>, burning more vigorous
    than ever, and packed with a decisive tone.
  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, Kanata simply responded in a carefree manner. Yes, it's her
    default mode, but the real takeaway here is her word choice being{" "}
    <strong>less aggressive</strong> than that of Haruka (from the Japanese's
    perspective).
  </p>
  <p>
    And have I mentioned that one time when she almost addressed Haruka by her{" "}
    <em>first name</em> in public? (Calling a person by first name has lots of
    meaning for Japanese people)
  </p>

      <em>I saw what you did there Kanata</em>

  </figure>
  <p>
    Loathe as I am to say this,{" "}
    <strong>Kanata's introduction as a character was a total mess</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It felt super annoying, infuriating even. If I had not the patience to stick
    with it to the very end,{" "}
    <em>I might very well have her at the bottom of my list now</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I guess there is a clear intention behind this weird behavior of
    Key because I honestly can't remember a time when they painted a character
    in any of their work with such outrageous traits.
  </p>
  <p>
    For real, even Sasami, who follows that "arrogant rich girl" trope, had a
    way better attitude than Kanata.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I digress. Kanata is a character that is{" "}
    <strong>meant to be hated </strong>one way or another.
  </p>
  <p>
    It doesn't matter how you feel about her when you finish Haruka's route or
    hers or the whole game. Essentially,{" "}
    <em>you must grow to despise Kanata first</em> to grasp the scope and
    complexity of her story at the turning points.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
    <img

  </figure>
  <p>
    But to get back on track, the whole point of Kanata's doing these horrendous
    deeds is to <strong>shield Haruka from self-destruction</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As shown in the bad endings of her route, Haruka was highly{" "}
    <strong>vulnerable</strong> and in dire need of attention, affection, or a "
    <strong>shelter</strong>."
  </p>
  <p>
    That is the exact reason why Kanata must severe any contact that could make
    Haruka being dependent on, for the moment she got{" "}
    <strong>"separated"</strong> from them is when things start to{" "}
    <em>crumble</em>.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/20210808160912_1-1.webp"

      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    To make matters worse,{" "}
    <em>
      not like the main family from the mountain would sit tight and let things
      roam free
    </em>{" "}
    either.
  </p>
  <p>
    Seriously, they went out of their way to establish an intricate intelligence
    network just to track down <strong>every movement </strong>of Haruka and
    respond to any sight of anomaly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember when Haruka mentioned that she got bullied in elementary school and{" "}
    <em>nobody batted an eye</em>? Or how everyone in her class, or even the
    whole school at present, would not go easy on her.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would not be an<strong> </strong>overstatement to call the
    Futakis/Saigusa <strong>OP</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently, Kanata didn't warn the Busters randomly but rather because she
    legit thought of the best for them, at least that's what she believed, given
    the tricky position she was placed in.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-08-07-20_39_33-Greenshot.webp"

  </figure>
  <p>
    Regarding the father issue, though <strong>undisclosed</strong> in the
    story, I am quite positive that <em>Kanata already got it figured out</em>{" "}
    because, as the family heir, she could make good use of the resources at her
    disposal on top of her talents in various fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evidently, when you look at Haruka's bad endings again, had she been told of
    the truth, she would have 100%{" "}
    <em>suffered another major mental breakdown</em>, despite the pretense of
    seeking closure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Haruka is just that <strong>innocent and fragil</strong>e, which is why
    Kanata must do whatever it takes to preserve that one distinct feature of
    her sister.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

    At the same time, the anime adaptation actually provided some hints
    supporting the idea that{" "}
    <a href="https://littlebusters.fandom.com/wiki/Haruka_Saigusa#:~:text=Haruka%20is%20actually%20Shou%20Saigusa's%20daughter">
      Haruka is Shou's daughter
    </a>
    , as <em>the other father shares the same eye color as Kanata</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, though this is my headcanon, it would hit home if Kanata had
    figured out everything since she{" "}
    <strong>could have released herself </strong>from the Futaki's relentless
    skepticism.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that was out of the question. Kanata would rather have Haruka<em> </em>
    take the <strong>"blue pill"</strong> to continue her life without knowing the
    why than being torn apart any further.

    <h2>
      <b>External Factor</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    For an ambitious world-building like Little Busters,{" "}
    <em>I tend to avoid overthinking about the meta</em>. Welp, maybe if the
    execution feels organic enough, then yeah, I guess there's no point sweating
    over the small details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Surprisingly, for Kanata's route, this was the one time in my LB journey
    that forced me to spend extra effort trying to piece together{" "}
    <em>what was running behind the scene.</em>
  </p>
  <p>The result? More or less thought-provoking.</p>
  <p>
    To cut down to the chase, Haruka's route, along with any of the routes that
    took place <strong>pre</strong>-Refrain, is a product of the "
    <strong>other" </strong>realm;<strong> </strong>thus they are hardly
    canonical or part of the <strong>prime</strong> world.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is not to say that everything that happened back then was{" "}
    <em>irrelevant</em> as the story passed that Refrain's landmark.
  </p>
  <p>
    As shown in one of the interclude in Kanata's route, there was this strange
    scene where the twins exchanged words in what seemed to be the{" "}
    <strong>transitioning </strong>phase.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/Kanata-unrelenting-will-external-factor-1.webp"

    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Maybe, just maybe, all of the events in Haruka's route were merely an{" "}
    <strong>illusion</strong> of the misfortuned girl who thought of her older
    sister as nothing but a tyrant, villainous existence.
  </p>
  <p>
    I must once again emphasize that the way Key built Kanata up in Haruka's
    route felt incredibly out of their character.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was <strong>abundantly toxic </strong>and filled with a mega "F U" tone.
    Therefore, one plausible explanation for this transgression lies in{" "}
    <em>the structure of Haruka's route:</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Her{" "}
      <strong>
        <u>pain</u>
      </strong>
      :
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Haruka could only view Kanata as a ruthless and bullying sister. This,
        however, seems to be Haruka's <strong>projection</strong> thanks to her
        obsession stemming from the hellish days of the past.
      </li>
      <li>
        I mean, <em>Haruka was right there when Kanata gave up her "future"</em>{" "}
        to get her out of that shithole...
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Her{" "}
      <strong>
        <u>regret: </u>
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Kanata had always been that same caretaking older sis who would always
          do 110% for her precious Haruka.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also pointed out earlier that Haruka did <strong>REMEMBER</strong>{" "}
          the promise between the two; hence, it would make perfect sense for
          her to <strong>"formulate" her convenient image of Kanata</strong> in
          this dreamworld, thus resulting in that poignant revelation at the
          endgame.
        </li>
        <li>
          This would answer why things went so smoothly for the twins{" "}
          <strong>post</strong>-Refrain.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Her{" "}
      <strong>
        <u>desire: </u>
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Simply put, Haruka <strong>subconsciously</strong> orchestrated all of
          the commotions AND solved them on her own, which aligns with the{" "}
          <em>"search in your heart"</em> thingy at the finale 😂
        </li>
        <li>
          Disregarding that corny aspect, everything else is quite clear when
          you pay attention to Haruka's monologues as well as the way things
          resolved at her endgame.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    Suppose they planned it that way to be canon, then hats off to them for
    taking this ballsy approach and didn't hesitate to{" "}
    <strong>break off their "shell"</strong> for once.
  </p>
  <p>
    But on the off chance that my deduction was correct,{" "}
    <em>the dots should all be connected </em>with how Kanata miraculously
    turned 180degree the moment we pick her route choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Either that or I'm overanalyzing, and things are as straightforward as they
    are.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, this gave rise to a new puzzle: how was Kanata granted access
    to that dreamland despite having{" "}
    <strong>no connection to the field trip</strong> accident whatsoever?
  </p>
  <p>
    From my understanding, that hallucination verse should be{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>exclusive to the LB gang,</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    and any other characters introduced there were basically{" "}
    <strong>NPC</strong> or some sort, meaning{" "}
    <em>they couldn't have a "will" of their own or such</em>, but whatever,
    lol.

    <h2>

  <p>
    When it comes to Kanata's design, I can only think of one word:{" "}
    <strong>unstoppable</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spanned across the entirety of her story, Kanata had her gaze fixed solely
    on what lies ahead, not on what was left behind.

    It goes without saying, Kanata always gives off this
    <strong> "boss music"</strong> vibe whenever she's on a roll.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if the whole world were against her, she would still hold her head
    high, fending off any threat that dare challenge her stance.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, this feels a bit edgy, but as I got to revisit some of her
    infamous moments, knowing the full context of the story,{" "}
    <em>I got to admire her determination even more</em>.

    To put it into perspective, the main selling point of this subplot is

  <p>
    Technically speaking, she didn't do this to push Haruka down to a pit of
    despair, but rather,{" "}

    And holy shiet, that fallout under the rain is easily one of my favorite

    Admittedly, building up <strong>strong</strong> characters only to reveal
    their <strong>weak</strong> sides later is not so uncommon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite having seen that coming from miles away, I must say that Kanata's
    endgame was <strong>kino</strong> from a <em>thematic standpoint</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, the plot is pretty <strong>dumb</strong> and full of bs, but it's not
    like it completely deflected the whole flow of the story and even managed to
    squeeze a few good themes out of it, so fine by me.

      Why do they always have to pull this same old harsh family tradition crap,
      but whatever
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Anyhow, the reason why Kanata's emotional outburst won over me is partially
    due to <em>how weak I am against that kind of sisterhood</em>, for it's a
    rarely explored theme in 2D stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, this is probably the first time I got to immerse myself in such a
    fiery sister's dispute.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, the two of them were coming at each other's throats for a myriad of
    occasions, spitting out insults, trying to "steal" from the other, and even
    going as far as attempting{" "}

    </a>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    But in the end, like one of their fathers said,{" "}
    <em>it's just a sibling quarrel</em>. They are family, and family take care
    of one another.

    Regardless of her apparent disdain, Haruka wished to retake those regular
    days with her onee-chan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, Kanata had been{" "}
    <em>silently facing off against innumerable odds</em>, all to preserve
    Haruka's last bit of sanity.
  </p>
  <p>
    If not for her <em>unshakable sister love</em>, Kanata would have given up
    entirely and <strong>corrupted</strong> to something genuinely sinister.

    It was so depressing to see things played out that way, and the progression
    was downright thorny.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, it reminded me of a <strong>similar scenario</strong> in the
    infamous Umineko saga, which also happens to feature one of my all-time
    favorite characters (you can guess who).
  </p>
  <p>But you know what they say, at the end of the tunnel, there's light.</p>
  <p>
    And I don't know about you; seeing Kanata breaking down in tears as she
    unraveled the truth <em>with a heartfelt soundtrack</em> playing in the
    background was simply cathartic.

    I'm not exaggerating one bit, but{" "}
    <strong>her voice still lingers over my mind</strong> as I'm writing this.
  </p>
  <p>
    And damn, the visual novel was good, but the anime{" "}
    <em>just had to kick it up a notch </em>by further refining the climax in
    this fascinating "fragment" of the LB verse.
  </p>
  <p>
    Usually, I would not take anime adaptations seriously, for{" "}
    <em>they tend to be very lazily done</em> in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, for this one rare exception, LB is truly blessed to have a
    powerful "assistance" at its side, <strong>complementing</strong> what the
    novel lacks in terms of visual<strong> clarity</strong> and sublime{" "}
    <strong>presentation</strong>.

      <b>Her Route</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Though Futaki Kanata is <strong>unquestionably at her</strong>{" "}
    <strong>peak </strong>during Haruka's late-game (<em>which is ironic</em>),
    I would say her own "route" wasn't even half as bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    It sure as hell was wonky for some parts. Nonetheless, the tradeoff is the
    emergence of some <em>compelling substances</em> to keep things fresh.
  </p>

    For instance, that immensely evocative flashback sequences{" "}
    <em>almost made me shed a teardrop or two</em>, which is a feat that not all
    drama series can achieve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside, the connection between this route and Haruka's with{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>Refrain as the middleman</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    is pretty whimsical to see.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vague as it was, I like how they tried to <em>incorporate the meta</em> into
    this route to make it feel <strong>interlinked.</strong>
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img

  <p>
    Regarding the <em>"don't come near me"</em> early game, I feel like it could
    have been handled way better (in fact, the anime got that covered, damn) by{" "}
    <strong>balancing </strong>Kanata's tone and her intention, but that's just
    a minor issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall I'd say Kanata's route was decently planned from the start with some
    good hints and successfully maintained the <strong>integrity</strong> of
    Kanata's initial characterization in Haruka's route, namely how she chose to
    go against the{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>"looks don't matter"</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    trope, which is nice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from that, witnessing the esteemed chairwoman of the prefect regime
    breaking school regulations, going rogue, and eloping was quite fun and
    satisfying.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd say <em>this is the happy ending she deserves.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, it was a breath of fresh air exploring the unexpected sides of
    Kanata, from <strong>blushing</strong>, to <strong>tsun-tsun</strong>, to
    full maiden mode.

  <p>
    And gosh, I could not stop replaying these flirting scenes while binging the
    anime because, again,{" "}
    <em>
      they nailed her expression and gesture so well that it made my heart skip
      a beat.
    </em>
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>Bottomline</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    To be blunt, Kanata as an entity is <strong>pure sensation</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm aware that I'm getting ahead of myself, but recently,{" "}
    <em>I tend to prefer daring and transparent things</em>. Even better, if
    they don't shy away from exposing the <strong>ugly sides </strong>and
    ridding themselves of the <strong>traditions</strong>, that's just icing on
    the cake.
  </p>
  <p>
    Honestly, it's okay if you still find Kanata detestable{" "}
    <em>so long as you acknowledge that it couldn't be helped.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Almost forgot. I can't stress enough how fucking awesome her VA is{" "}
    <strong>(Suzuki Keiko)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, the ability to <strong>draw the stark contrast</strong> between TWIN
    characters and remain true to their personalities and behaviors{" "}
    <em>simultaneously</em> is no small feat.
  </p>
  <p>
    She delivered so many great lines, but that{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>"Come at me like you mean it"</em>
    </strong>{" "}
    is probably my favorite performance of this fantastic seiyuu.

  <p>
    Ultimately, Futaki Kanata is an <strong>ever-stoic</strong> girl on the
    front, but deep within her lies a{" "}
    <strong>paramount emotional burden </strong>that spectacularly flipped
    everything upside down at the pivotal moment of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, Kanata isn't just one tough cookie, but also a waifu that can
    cook, fix stuff (in the anime). More importantly,{" "}
    <strong>
      she always put her "family," the real, genuine one, above all else
    </strong>
    . To me, <em>that alone is a big win as waifu material.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    P/S: I've been having this weird fantasy of a bizarre{" "}
    <em>crossover between LB and Muv-Luv Alternative</em> where Kanata would be
    a major badass but not without some tragedy befalling upon her...
