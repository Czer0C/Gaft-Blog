    Welp, can’t get a more straightforward title than this (the Jap one,{" "}
    <strong>Gakkou no Kaidan</strong>, sounds much cooler though). I came into
    this anime with barely any expectation, got to know it randomly from a
    magazine that I was reading but seriously I wasn’t even taking the whole
    topic seriously lmao, just saw a small shot from this anime and then my mind
    just went “why not?”.{" "}
    <s>
      Definitely not because I was looking to learn more about Japanese ghost
      stories or anything like that.

    First thing first, let’s have a quick check-up at the anime’s peripherals.
    Packed with an episodic format and a relatively obvious formula, at the
    first glance the anime sure appears to be bland, and while it does have a
    major drawback with a really slow build-up in almost every episode, the
    climax always managed to leave something behind to mull over, sometimes a
    good one even. The OP is pretty chilling but, not gonna lie, it feels a bit
    out of place. If anything, I really like is how the details are meticulously
    handled in this anime. However, oft-time there were some pretty out-of-place
    moments, and they kind of spoiled the mood, but not that much of a big deal
    when viewed as a whole picture so meh.

    Plot-wise, there’s nothing special about it, to be honest, pretty much can
    be summed up in a single phrase: “group of friends solving supernatural
    incidents after school”. In fact, if I were to go on full nitpicking mode
    the anime has a lot of problems scattered in many segments, mainly plot
    holes and some really dumb moments that either made no sense or just annoyed
    me greatly. Fortunately, I was in a rather good mood while watching this and
    frankly, those things didn’t amount up to the whole scale of the anime so
    they could be somewhat overlooked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the flaws, the major highlight of this anime lies in the good uses
    of sound effects and directing to bolster the turning point and invoke some
    major positive feelings toward the story. Really, they sure know how to nail
    the atmosphere of the climax, especially the BGM which is pretty fire.
    Pretty sure Ghost Stories is not the first of its kind but it’s always a
    sight to behold to see how the major elements are blended so well together
    in an anime (very typical of the 2000s I’d say, and Ghost Stories does give
    off a “Cardcaptor Sakura” vibe to me).

    The “scary” parts are no doubt hit or miss, just like every single “horror”
    story, but I prefer to let that one a bit on the loose side because I
    personally think it’s not the main focus of the anime, but more about
    adventure and stuff. If anything though, it’s the random fanservice that
    kinda got in the way and thus renders me unable to take the show seriously
    sometimes.

    The cast is probably what gives me the most mixed feelings. On one hand, I
    do enjoy the slice of life elements that came from them and the banter
    sometimes works, but when the plot actually kicked in, I lost count of the
    number of times that I got really irritated for their inability to “develop”
    through the course of almost 20 episodes. Not to mention they can be
    annoying at times (can’t be helped because it’s a really fitting nature of
    elementary schoolers).
  </p>
  <p>
    Honestly, I expected a lot more than that, I get it that it’s in episodic
    format and the characters are all very young, but cmon, they have been
    through all that for dozens of times and still got the usual reaction to how
    things went through in the mid to late game, which is pretty stupid no
    matter how I look at it. One can argue it’s just “plot” to create suspense
    but even so, it’s really badly handled. The only good thing I can say about
    this is how based af Momoko is, and it goes double when Satsuki’s mom is
    involved.

    What really got me on the salt train is the fact that there were so many
    wasted potentials in terms of the development of plot and characters. They
    really nailed the introductory chapters with lore and some mysteries, but
    then they just all got tossed away or simply neglected, downgraded to being
    mere plot devices which is really lame. Not until the very very concluding
    moments that those elements came into play, which was kinda late from how I
    see it as it just felt forced and thus failed to deliver a wholesome
    experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    With all that being said, I did have a lot of enjoyment. There were some
    really well-done dramatic scenes that almost took my breath away. Like the
    anime’s main theme is about ghost stories or urban legends but they didn’t
    forget to mix some extra drama in to spice it up, which is commendable.
    Simply put, I had some laugh, I had some chills, and I had some awe, so
    well, not bad of a ride I guess.
