    Woohoo finally an episode mostly about Oberstein. First thing first, his
    priority has always been “cleaning up” the workplace, no matter where he is
    lol. For real, he’s too busy to pay attention to Bittenfield mocking at him
    or the other admiral who don’t accompany him. We can see that this guy is a
    man who always has planned ahead, and when given the right time he’ll
    execute them right away, what a diligent man. I love how they say
    “grass-mowing” as it shows that Oberstein cares about the minor detail.

    The conversation with the 3 admirals was simply epic, no facial expression,
    just words, he poured all of the frustration he held inside for a while into
    all of them at the same time, giving me a hard laugh as well. Even after he
    got assaulted by Bittenfield, he immediately got back to his desk without
    saying anything back, I’m starting to think this guy is way even more than a
    masochist -_-.

    The problem is, he doesn’t care what others think, which is why they hate
    him so much. He doesn’t talk to anyone else except when it comes to
    work-related matters, he doesn’t share his thought or idea with the other
    contemporaries, which is also why people don’t understand him, they think
    he’s a suspicious man who’s up for something bad.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the record, I somewhat agree with the way he works, it is cruel and
    against most people’s will in the short term, but if you think about the
    long term it’s worth it. Since he always plans his work meticulously, he
    must have thought of all the possibilities that can occur after something’s
    done, which is why he doesn’t hesitate to make such a daring plan despite
    being hated by many. Overall a great episode, getting to love Oberstein more
    even though his screentime is short -_-.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can see while there’s a lot of people come to like Oberstein from this
    episode, those on the opposite side would simply bring back the Westerland
    and Kircheis’s death as a means to “sink” Oberstein’s reputation down.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I have nothing to say about Westerland since it’s debatable,
    Kircheis’s death, on the other hand, is a different matter. If you really
    think Oberstein wanted Kircheis's death then I think you’re wrong, it was
    Oberstein’s miscalculation on his plan, he didn’t expect that someone would
    make such a daring assassination attempt which caused a long-lasting impact
    on Reinhard and even himself as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Firstly, if he wanted Kircheis dead, he would have done it in a safer way,
    which at least doesn’t involve Reinhard on the scene. I mean Reinhard could
    have got himself killed during that incident, and Oberstein was willing to
    take the hit for Reinhard’s sake.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, if it was Oberstein that got killed instead of Kircheis, how could
    he proceed to further expand his plan and scheme to scour the Empire of the
    Goldenbaum’s remnants, how could he aid Reinhard by being the “shadow” to
    counter the “light” (Kircheis). So tell me, why would Oberstein risk that
    much just to get rid of someone who merely stood in his way?
  </p>

  <p>
    To get further into this matter, what Oberstein wanted was a FAIR judgment
    from Reinhard, as he favors Kircheis too much, which would cause a great
    dispute among his subordinates. Oberstein never wanted Kircheis dead, he
    just wanted Reinhard to treat everyone as equal, no more no less, thus
    persuading Reinhard into making changes on personnel policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    While many people think that Oberstein is a cold-hearted, emotionless
    “robot”, he has occasionally expressed his “human” part (Or to be more
    precise, he does care about what’s going on around him), which I believe was
    done subconsciously: like at the aftermath of Reuenthal’s rebellion or
    Kircheis’s death (his speech about <strong>light </strong>and{" "}
    <strong>shadow</strong>), or about the dog that he picked…
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason why Oberstein has such a cold view towards everything could be
    linked to his past, which was revealed by Schenkopp. Even when he was just a
    kid, his peers didn’t seem to like him (Schenkopp showed us lol), hence his
    being isolated, failed to understand the basic things of a human need such
    as love, care, affection, happiness, etc., thus leading him to be such a
    Machiavellian guy.
