    Firstly, Oberstein seems to be still doing all the hard jobs despite being
    hated by everyone. I somewhat feel really bad for the guy, however, the
    second half of this episode overshadows everything else, perhaps even the
    last few intense episodes as well.

    While he’s still being so carefree, I thought he’s gonna make it out alive after
    several narrow escapes happened before, but what happened afterward is really
    odd, so unexpected, unpleasantly.

    It seems although Yang has always been calm, deep down inside he feels
    guilty toward all the life he’s taken, even if it’s for the sake of his
    people, for his own course which he believes to be the righteous one.
  </p>
  <p>
    How sad it is, everything happened too swift, dang the author, I thought if
    he’s going to die, at least he should have a deathmatch with Reinhard like
    they always had before, the final showdown of the 2 most powerful being in
    the galaxy…
  </p>
  <p>
    But well, life’s suck, must be what the author wants to imply here. He can
    elegantly control thousands of ships, overcome hundred of obstacles, come up
    with weird yet effective plans, surpass even the most powerful man in the
    galaxy, yet adversary will always be there to remind us that no matter how
    calculative, smart, cunning you are, you can not escape fate.
  </p>
  <p>
    RIP Yang, back in the first few episodes, when he was approached by a kid
    who said he want to become a soldier like Yang, Yang said that he wouldn’t
    have to because the galaxy would be at peace by then. Let’s hope Yang’s word
    will come true through his legacy.
