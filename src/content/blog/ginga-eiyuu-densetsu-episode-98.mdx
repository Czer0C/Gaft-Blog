    LoGH has been a magnificent ride so far and it has yet to show sign of
    slowing down the momentum. Before going in I had set really high expectation
    for this anime and usually that could go awfully wrong. However, I’m really
    glad that, after coming this far, it could still stand firm say “Not this
    time”.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this is it, a bitter demise of another great character of the show. The
    pacing was surely stretched a bit more than usual, which helped the viewers
    get a grasp of “the longest day” in Reuenthal’s life.
  </p>
  <blockquote>Wolf de Strum is crying</blockquote>
  <p>
    The episode started with Reuenthal entrusting the governing responsibility
    to someone else capable, which is pure awesome as it adds more layer to his
    personality. War is one thing, but administration is administration, he must
    fulfill each role in the fullest way and didn’t neglect either of them.

  <p>
    There were a lot of great lines in this one, I lost count of them and
    perhaps the most distinct ones are how Reuenthal stated the harsh truth
    about the “<strong>Existence that controls birth</strong>” and how he coldly
    claimed that he was <strong>enjoying </strong>the process of dying, which
    really hurts to hear, yet feels extraordinarily strong.

    To me, the highlight of this episode is when Reuenthal saw his son for the{" "}
    <em>
      <em>first </em>
    </em>
    and
    <em>
      <em>last </em>
    </em>
    time. He never wanted one, but one was born to him, and he made the most reasonable
    decision without delay, depicting the fact that even when near death he’s still
    capable of being calm and thinking clearly. This awkward reunion probably added
    more salt to the tragic story of Reuenthal, because, after all, the woman and
    the child somewhat contributed to his uprising.
  </p>

  <p>
    The woman who bore his child also got her own development, to me this is the
    real “tsundere”. On the surface she despites Reuenthal, but deep inside her,
    she is <strong>attracted </strong>to him, thus wanting to{" "}
    <em>
      <em>know more</em>
    </em>{" "}
    about him, which is why she didn’t leave him after given many opportunities
    to do so. Seeing Reuenthal slowly dying in agony must have somewhat pained
    her as well. The scene where she wiped Reuenthals’s sweat with the
    handkerchief under the setting sun is just oddly breathtaking.

  <p>
    I find it ironic that two of the things Reuenthal <strong>hates </strong>the
    most suddenly came by his side at the very last moment of his life. However,
    it appears that he didn’t feel that way anymore, by saying that he wanted to
    grant a woman’s wish, and how he thoroughly thought of a way to ensure the
    healthy life of his son, Reuenthal finally came to a compromise, ridding
    himself of the past.

    Reuenthal’s final words hit me hard. Him calling out the name of the
    remaining “Fantastic Four” member sent shivers down my spine. He respects
    every single member of the team, especially Reinhard. He has always{" "}
    <strong>followed </strong>Reinhard. However, this man’s pride and honor are
    too complicated, especially when it comes to this era.
  </p>
  <p>
    On one hand, he dedicated himself to someone he really{" "}
    <em>
      <em>respects </em>
    </em>
    and
    <em>
      <em>admires</em>
    </em>
    {", but on the other, he feels the "}
    <em>
      <em>urge </em>
    </em>
    and
    <em>
      <em>temptation </em>
    </em>
    to surpass that person as well, because after spending a long time together,
    they know each other well, know what the other want, which explains why narrator
    said Reinhard’s the one who didn’t realize he wanted the fight.

  <p>
    The fact that he decided to do something against his nature (kill Truniht,
    an unarmed man) just because he insulted Reinhard proves how deep their bond
    is.

    Reuenthal just simply fulfilled his role, combined with the constantly
    changing circumstances (the Terraists, Oberstein{" "}
    <strong>[50% innocent]</strong>, Lang, etc.), which made him filled with
    hesitation and doubts. He knew he would not win, still, he fought, that
    proves how “rich” his characteristic is, a perfect example of what makes a
    “hero”.
  </p>
  <p>
    As death was drawing near, he continued to think of his best friend who had
    been with him for many years. After all the hardship they went through, he
    couldn’t make it in time to be by Reuenthal’s side in his last breath,
    which, as Reuenthal said, tainted his presumptuous nickname “Gale Wolf”. The
    two glasses of wine is also a unique symbolism between the duo, only they
    can make such a simple hobby seems so meaningful.

    This is just too much of a tragic hero, RIP Reuenthal, my most favorite
    character of the show.

    On a side note, what a powerful bromance moment. Mittermeyer had the
    potential of becoming something great, I wish he had more complexity like
    Reuenthal, but well I guess that’s also of the Author’s intention for the
    story.

    Lastly, Oberstein made a remark about Reunthal’s rebellion, which is, in my
    opinion, the most <strong>out of character</strong> moment of him. This
    indicates that Reuenthal’s deed has made a great{" "}
    <em>
      <em>impact </em>
    </em>
    on Oberstein. For someone who thinks he <strong>understands </strong>how the
    Imperial admirals behave, and that he can easily calculate and predict their
    move, this is perhaps his biggest miscalculation, as he never expected Reuenthal
    to cause such astronomical turbulence over something seemingly trivial.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the normally calm, cold, and gloomy Oberstein to speak out his opinion
    on some people who’re mostly not of his concern, could this be a hint of his
    jealousy or perhaps admiration of the noble friendship between Mittermeyer
    and Reuenthal? This might also imply that Oberstein is not at all 100%{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>machine</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    , he does care about his surroundings, he does have <strong>
      emotion{" "}
    </strong>to express as everyone does, it might just be that he had restrained
    himself from showing them all the time, only to let it slip out after such an
    outrageous incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wow, what a sublime episode. Concluding the story of one of the major
    characters is one thing, but putting all 3 Imperial Fleet Admirals together
    as well as giving them subtle character development is legit overkill. And
    to think there’s still 12 episodes left…
