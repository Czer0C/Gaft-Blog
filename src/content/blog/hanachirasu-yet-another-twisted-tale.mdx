  <p>
    Hanachirasu is another short work from Nitroplus that has a rather
    interesting setting but not without some wasted potential. To be completely
    blunt, this feels like a “draft” version of something bigger and more
    ambitious, but in the end, I still enjoyed it regardless of the flaws.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taken in kind of an alternate historical timeline, they sure nailed the
    “samurai” theme with lots of political struggle on the surface, albeit never
    really dug deep into that matter (to be expected from a short VN like this).
    The main story revolves around “vengeance” from not 1 but 2 dudes with fancy
    swordsmanship and the likes. Nothing new right? However, it actually has
    some sort of a “clash of ideals” vibe to the story (same goal, different
    method, and mindset). Though vengeance is the key theme, what drove them to
    that point is really what got me intrigued.

    While I do have some complaints regarding the pacing, especially when it
    comes to info-dumping about swordplay and strategy analysis, at the end of a
    particular event, it all paid off (somewhat). There was satisfaction, there
    was a severe surge of chill, and there was even a bit of pitifulness seeing
    those twists played out. One of the things I like the most about the writing
    is how they make full use of the lore that had been established earlier in
    order to create a strong impact when it comes into play later.

    On a different note, despite being a short VN, Hanachirasu still tries to
    cramp some alternative endings in this pretty tight space, some of which has
    interesting “what-ifs” elements to it, some are just downright meme material
    so lol, I guess it’s still worth it for shit and giggles.

    That being said, the cast is probably where I got a bit let down. The
    protagonist is pretty well written, regardless of his questionable
    motivation (could use some more polishing here though), he did his part well
    to carry the story to a fitting ending of his nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the supporting cast is pretty much wasted, even the deuteragonist
    who only got some spotlight at the very late game, which doesn’t feel
    “complete” to me in all honesty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of them are just straight-up hype tools for power-up thingy but
    whatever, not like I can ask much from a short VN (actually I think they do
    possess some sort of idealism within but it got washed up fast due to the
    flow of the story so rip).
  </p>
  <p>
    Nonetheless, I did genuinely enjoy some of their conclusions, especially
    Yumi, Itsurin, and Shou (later hinted to be the “THAT GIRL”, the cause of
    all this ruckus, a major WTF moment for me).
  </p>
  <p>
    While definitely not being well developed, they still managed to leave
    something behind for me to think over, like really Akane, sure what the
    fiancee did was wrong but that’s no reason to kill her nigga, you might be a
    badass protagonist but still a dick at heart LMAO. And by the way, when I
    think about it, they sure enjoy slicing up women in this VN (I counted 4…).

    It wouldn’t hurt to back a good story up with neat visuals and effects.
    Hanachirasu managed to have them both somewhat covered. Character design is
    definitely a plus to me, while the setting helps a bit, they don’t follow
    the usual generic stereotype and kinda betray our expectations in a
    whimsical way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like Akena at first glance appears to be straight-up gay shit material and
    weak but turned out to be pretty wild and cool (I guess). Some effects were
    well used at dramatic moments to enhance the significance or impact of the
    action or of sort, which is cool.

    The <s>waifu</s> female design is also what captivates me, there seem to be
    2 main traits when it comes to this regard which is the{" "}
    <strong>pure </strong>feminine elegant style and the one filled with{" "}
    <strong>powerful </strong>"aura" of a mature and profound woman type{" "}
    <s>(definitely not talking about how busty they are lmao)</s>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, while the sound isn’t a really strong element in Hanachirasu,
    especially the BGM, I do enjoy the theme track as well as the banging ED
    since it nails the atmosphere so much.

    To wrap this up, Hanachirasu was, in fact, a fairly “standard” experience to
    me. I would be lying to say I’ve not grown used/dull to this kind of
    depressing/fucked up stories but well, it definitely managed to score a bit
    of impact on me, partly thanks to the clever execution that is rarely seen
    in any story overall.
  </p>
  <p>
    If anything, I’m more fired up to anticipate Muramasa since it’s from the
    same creator and is a full-fledged work compared to this one.
