      <strong>Note</strong>: at the time of this post the Kaguya Love is War
      series was at chapter <strong>186</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    There can be no more doubt, the fact that this girl’s awesomeness just kept
    piling up chapter after chapter is the undeniable proof of her supreme
    development.
  </p>
  <p>
    The bond between <strong>master </strong>and <strong>servant </strong>has
    been one of my favorite “spice” in a story. Even though this theme has been
    used quite a lot in many series, few managed to achieve such equilibrium as
    the Kaguya manga did, for normally they only focus on the “master” and
    completely ditch the “servant”, and Akasaka did just the right thing to
    counter that imbalance.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know this sounds biased for I’m a really big fan of Ai Hayasaka, but I
    just couldn’t help cheering for her even though what she has committed is
    unforgivable in said relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the outlook it just seems like everything between the two of them is
    fake, kinda like how Oregairu usually addresses the “genuine” thing, and
    yeah it’s understandable if you think of it that way.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the latest chapter, 186, pretty much cleared all that cliche and
    I’d argue that even without it, there’s been plenty of hints way back in the
    earlier chapters to support the idea that Ai Hayasaka never truly treated
    Kaguya as a mere target for her goal.

    Even though her “job” was to spy on Kaguya, she genuinely enjoyed those
    interactions, everything wasn’t strictly business, simply put she let her
    sentiment butt in, which is also the origin of her sense of guilt.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s pretty terrifying to look at it from a bird-eye view, being forced to
    do something against her will, and for a pretty fucking long time it slowly
    eat away her mind and she finally snapped and thus led to the current event.

    So yeah even though it’s all pretty obvious in this chapter, I still wanna
    address this matter a bit more thoroughly because Ai Hayasaka has more depth
    to her than what many people think.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her having many faces is a pretty clever way to hide her true self, you can
    speculate however you want but so long as it’s not revealed, nothing matters
    can be concluded.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s why this chapter is such a bomb, it blew away all doubts and hit
    right at the feel. Seeing the “master” and “servant” finally drop all the
    formality to have a proper talk is just something.
  </p>
  <p>
    And what’s more, is how Ai can be honest to herself and Kaguya got to learn
    something new. Props to Kaguya for bringing Ai out of her shell and now they
    can finally be “real friends” I guess? Lol

      Overall, Ai Hayasaka has been constantly transforming into various
      different phases during the last few chapters. From a humble servant to a
      guilty criminal to a hopeless girl, to a major badass spygirl, and
      eventually the real, emotional, and caring “friend”.

    I’ve always enjoyed her moments in the manga, even though on the surface
    they were all an act, this chapter pretty much clears that up, and wow, that
    page where she cut her hair without hesitation to gain an opening is based
    af and pure gasm.
