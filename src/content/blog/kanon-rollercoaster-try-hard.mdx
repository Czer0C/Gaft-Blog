    Whew, another Key project added under my belt. While I must say it{" "}
    <em>kinda tripped a lot</em> in terms of writing perspective, it wasn't
    entirely painful to read, to say the least.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, though, I cannot shake off the possibility of this "prototype" work
    of Key could have turned out to be<em> something quite spectacular </em>had
    they been invested more thoroughly.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what do I know, maybe they already did learn from their past mistake to
    realized their flagships series later on such as <strong>Clannad </strong>or{" "}
    <strong>Little Busters!</strong>, but whatever.

      From this half-assed sisterly dilemma to the clusterf*** of LB (or
      Clannad), damn nice
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    It goes without saying, this is still Key's very <strong>first </strong>
    work, so I sort of understand the inevitable shortcomings that spread all over
    Kanon. Regardless, I'm not going to go easy on it just because of the technical
    disadvantage it had given the release year (<strong>1999</strong>
    !).
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean yeah, they might have struggled a lot to get the work running back in
    the old days, hence a <strong>severe lack of care </strong>for character
    polishing and plot coherency.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, though, I think the core structure of every work should have
    something meaningful to offer rather than having unclear direction or trying
    to <em>cram as much superficial value as possibl</em>e to distract the
    audience from its critical drawbacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Firstly, I'll list out some of the major problems I've had while reading
    Kanon. The biggest of all is, obviously,{" "}
    <strong>its propensity towards forcing emotion out of the readers.</strong>
  </p>

      You might be thinking, <em>doesn't that apply to all of Key works?</em>{" "}
      Yes, that's true, but I feel like Kanon just had to take it to a whole
      nother level that even me in my "retired" mode could not help but get
      annoyed at this outrageous obstinacy of theirs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Maybe they're trying to <strong>match the air</strong> of the story to the
      designated setting full of snowy and kinda <strong>"bluish"</strong> tone,
      which is not a wrong approach but the execution was terribly lousy and not
      at all effective.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    On top of that, the plot had{" "}
    <em>so little to offer that I almost always fell asleep</em> reading Kanon.
  </p>

      Ironically, Nayuki is like 100 times better in other routes than her own
      which is odd
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    No matter which route I got into, there was barely any entertaining value
    nor compelling substance to keep the ride engaging enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, the air can <em>occasionally </em>feel rather uplifting (thanks to
    the music of course) but for the most part, the process of getting to those
    climaxes felt very dull, bland, and not quite worth the time invested in all
    honesty.
  </p>
  <p>
    And don't even get me on with the <strong>non-sensical third-act</strong>{" "}
    approach they tend to rely on (you know, like, holding hand signing kumbaya
    and tadaa, the "blizzard" is gone).

    <figcaption>NGL this shot was kinda lit despite the cliche</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The cast, in the same vein, suffered quite a devasting blow to their overall
    "image" across the whole story. Would not actually be a lie to say I didn't
    expect anything from them, for the initial build-up did well to get my hope
    going, but as things got closer to the end for any route or over-arching
    plot, I could not help but be disappointed.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the bright side, however, Kanon did offer some rather{" "}
    <em>well-delivered atmospheric moments.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    To be more specific, there would often come a time where the novel suddenly
    transition smoothly to something I'd like to call a{" "}
    <strong>"hollow" state</strong>, which eased up my early frustration in
    preceding acts of the story (or the routes).
  </p>
  <p>
    The music doubtless has the biggest contribution in this regard, followed up
    by its{" "}
    <em>
      wonky cast that somehow didn't feel quite right to me earlier on but
      managed to gain a noticeable momentum at the moment of truth.
    </em>
  </p>

    <figcaption>Mai's endgame was pretty good</figcaption>

  <p>
    Thematically speaking, Kanon is probably the <strong>pioneer </strong>of the
    Key expedition due to the fact that many of their newer creations would
    <em> inherit this same energy within.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This might sound a bit confusing and perhaps contradictory, but as mentioned
    earlier, while I truly dislike the resolution of Kanon's in general (all
    routes seem to share this motif lol), the message it's trying to convey has
    more weight to it than it appears to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simply put, we're all but temporal beings, our lives do not last forever,
    therefore, while it's still possible to do so,
    <em> **live your life to the fullest**</em>, so when shit hits the fan, you won't
    have anything to regret.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yup, cliche, and cringey as that might have sound, I don't have any qualm
    with <em>going back to this cheesy mode</em> once in a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the record, it's not a groundbreaking concept yet fitting for something
    of this scale I'd say.
  </p>
  <p>
    Technical-wise, Kanon has a decent set of music to offer but that's about
    it. Some BGM was <strong>finely utilized </strong>to make the most of the
    dramatic showdown. The ED is not that great but the OP kinda nails the
    outlined picture of Kanon, I like the <strong>chilling vibe</strong>
    <em> </em>of it in contrast to typical dynamic Key music.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CG and character design, on the other hand, is, welp,
    <em> not too good</em> I guess (lel). Even if we disregard the obsolete technology,
    I just can't stand Key's mindset in crafting characters with that <strong>
      awkward eye pattern
    </strong>, <em>and this goes double when the color palette was also off the mark for some of the cast.</em>
  </p>

      Kaori's probably the only one with a decent design,{" "}
      <em>a shame though 'cause she was wasted</em>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    But yeah, these are more or less <strong>minor </strong>complaints. In fact,
    I'm actually impressed by how far Key has evolved when I look at their
    roadmap again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, I guess{" "}
    <em>
      I have already long passed the period of nitpicking and shitting on
      everything that doesn't end up the way I expect them to be.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Sure, Kanon is likely <strong>Key's weakest visual novel</strong> that I've
    stumbled upon, but again, for something that came out more than{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>two</strong> decades
    </em>{" "}
    ago, I would say it's not bad for acting as a "<strong>prototype</strong>"
    for something much more grandiose to come out later on (some might say{" "}
    <strong>Clannad </strong>but to me it's <strong>Little Busters!</strong>).
  </p>
  <p>
    To make a long story short, good concept, bad execution, and packs a
    commendable (yet short-lived) burst of emotion. Recommended for those who
    seek something chilling or to kill time, somewhat.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      P/S: no best girl propaganda this time because I couldn't find anyone
      worth going crazy over so welp.
