  <p>
    So I had a chance to revisit Toradora (again) and I must say that while it's
    pretty flawed on many levels (mostly thanks to the{" "}
    <strong>irritating abusive overtone </strong>that just gets in the way of
    what it is trying to convey), I don't think I can ever grow to hate it for 2
    reasons namely:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It's <em>one of the first anime </em>that got me into this 2D thingy, so
      in some way, it carries a certain amount of <strong>"weight" </strong>
      within.
    </li>
    <li>Ami is just fucking amazing.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    It's kinda weird that on my first <strong>two</strong> watches, I was
    totally into Taiga, overlooking all of the ruckuses that she tended to cause
    along the way of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, things changed drastically on the <strong>3rd </strong>time I set
    foot in this series (but gosh just how much time have I wasted on watching
    anime ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚).
  </p>
  <p>
    It probably had something to do with how{" "}
    <em>Ami was such an annoying character in the beginning</em> (many people
    share the same view I believe) that simply made me went full bias mode
    against her.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-06-06-19_40_30-Greenshot.webp"

      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    But what the hell do I know, as I decided to "switchgear", things developed
    in a completely unexpected route.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      Think of a situation where you don't wanna eat steak every day, and
      instead, you just want to get a salad for a change of pace.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    That's exactly what I did to Ami. In other words, I gave her another chance,
    or more like, I decided to{" "}
    <strong>"imbue" a positive opinion on her</strong> as I initiated my 3rd
    Toradora rewatch.
  </p>
  <p>The result? Hoh boy, absolutely astonishing.</p>

  <p>
    One of the main selling points of Ami is, without a doubt, her whimsical{" "}
    <strong>interaction with Ryuji</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think about it; these two arguably have the <em>least "forced"</em> moment
    together, as they always pour their heart out, mocking and teasing and
    "bullying" each other like it's just another day at the office, which is
    just something in all honesty.

    I mean yeah, some people argue that Ami never changed, and she still had
    that "queen bitch" attitude toward the end of the show, but they often
    forget that it was just the <strong>surface </strong>of her character and
    how deep down there she does care for her "crew", the real one, and how{" "}
    <em>she was even willing to go all out to display her resolve</em>, just
    goes to show how serious she was at that time.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-card-hascaption kg-image-card">

  <p>
    You can't expect people to change at the drop of a hat, and while I do agree
    that Ami's personality can be prickly sometimes, the big picture here is
    that she wasn't that same selfish, egotistical person as she once was during
    her introductory arc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of being not selfish, what <em>truly </em>sold Ami's character to
    me isn't her witty chemistry with Ryuji, but more so about her{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>dynamic relationship with Taiga</strong>.{" "}
    </em>
    It was wholesome to see Ami gradually <em>making progress</em> toward her bond
    with Taiga as the anime pressed on.

    I mean yeah, they did occasionally have some <strong>random </strong>quarrel
    there and then, but those moments are more or less <strong>banters </strong>
    between the girls, <em>
      just like how men tend to piss off their co-workers by faking a window
      update
    </em> or some sort ðŸ¤£.

  <p>
    On top of that, seeing Ami going out of her way to <strong>support </strong>
    Taiga in her romantic solution with Ryuji was fascinating and <em>
      a bit
    </em> heart-wrenching at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the one hand, Ami simply flexed her <em>sis-hood</em> (if that's even a
    thing but you get the idea) for Taiga, acting as a true "bro" in aiding her
    from either the <strong>shadow</strong> or <strong>directly</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, Ami herself was forced to give up on her (possibly) first
    love after concluding that she wasn't the chosen one.

    Seriously, though Ami never got into an emotional outburst like Minori or
    Taiga, the cleverly distributed closed-up shots featuring her{" "}
    <strong>subtle </strong>expression, gesture, and behaviors are more than
    enough to tell how much suffering Ami was holding within.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      It had got to the point that, oft times, Ami would fail to restrain
      herself and be forced to vex out her <strong>long-pressed</strong> feeling
      and sentiments, albeit in a cryptic manner beyond Ryuji's understanding
      (lel).

    Despite the <strong>tough front</strong> that Ami put on, how she always
    remained positive and cheerful, or how much of a "goddess" that people were
    making her out to be, Ami, after all, was <em>just a teenage girl</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therein, even she herself could not shake off the impact of
    <em>*insert 101 dilemmas that high-schoolers have to endure*.</em>

    She thought she knew everything. She was sure she got it all covered. Most
    of all, she felt no need for anything else in her life. Notwithstanding, the
    truth is far bitter than that.

  <p>
    Long story short,{" "}
    <strong>
      Ami was utterly <em>defeated</em>.
    </strong>
  </p>

    <h2>
      <b>But So What?</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    YES, She neither relied on pointless ranting nor underwent some sort of
    youthful crisis period. Maybe she did it offscreen, but the fact remains
    that she
    <strong>
      <em> got over it</em>
    </strong>
    and held her head high like a model she is.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that's why when I saw Ami went out of her way to back Taiga up, I could
    not help but be "YES, YOU GO GET IT, GIRL".

    It's funny how Toradora kinda parodied the common trope that{" "}
    <strong>only men can reinforce their bond after beefing</strong>, because
    that's exactly what happened to Ami and Taiga who are two girls with{" "}
    <strong>opposite</strong> personalities, went through so many arguments,
    physical abuse, and even an all-out competition, turned out to be{" "}
    <em>best of friends (sort of)</em> by the time the show crossed the finish
    line.

    Meanwhile, Ami held nothing back against Minori, and they even got into a
    brawl (literally). However, that didn't last long, as the two of them made
    out in the end for being in quite a similar position.
  </p>
  <p>
    From how I see it, they both got it all figured out from the start, but each
    chose to have a <em>different approach </em>to tackle the group's problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Minori prefers{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>standing from afar </strong>
    </em>
    to watch things unveiled, whereas Ami is the more active one and feels the need
    to
    <strong>
      <em>take matters into her own hands.</em>
    </strong>

    I'm not going to argue who was in the right or wrong, but overall the two of
    them did harbor good intentions for Taiga and Ryuji in the end, so yeah, I
    think it wasn't too spooky for them to settle the conflict in a short time
    (which was like 4 episodes).
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I also find the central theme revolving around Ami to be very
    compelling and poignant.

    To make a long story short, it encompasses the transition of a girl who went
    from{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>"I'm the best of the best"</em>
    </strong>{" "}
    to <em>questioning her own existence</em> (Ok that's a stretch but something
    like that) and advanced on an endeavor to re-discover herself.
  </p>
  <p>
    It might not have anything to do with the overall plot of Toradora, but it
    sure as hell gave Ami the substance to elevate herself{" "}
    <em>above the tier of a mediocre secondary heroine</em> who we always see
    getting <strong>sidetracked </strong>toward the second half of a series.

    Apart from Ami's intricate character development in store, she also has the

    Additionally, she can also be a fucking savage with some seriously sick burn

      In the end, what truly matters is <em>Ami got to be herself</em>.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    As a <strong>standalone </strong>instance and throughout roughly 20 episodes
    since her entrance to the anime, Ami had slowly yet surely carved her path
    to achieving the status of an outstanding <strong>instrument </strong>to the
    story of Toradora.
  </p>
  <p>
    And with that, <em>to hell with the tragic heroine trope</em>, Ami rocks!
