    <h3>
      <b>[SPOILERS WARNING]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    Gotta get straight to the point. I’d say his commanders in the center are
    more likely a discount version of MaKou and AKou, in this case, judging from
    their design and portrayal so far, Denrimi is leaning towards the “brain”
    type like MaKou while Sou’ou is a fighter like AKou.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the very least, according to MaKou’s officer's testaments on the night of
    the first day, these guys are fully capable of taking command of an entire
    wing, and they were all ready to be under either Sou’ou or Denrimi’s command
    after the loss of their master, so that should give some hype to them IMO.

  <p>
    Apart from that, while the commanders at the center might be a bit below
    MaKou and AKou, its soldiers might not be the case. Since it’s the Ousen’s
    core army, and we all know Ousen values his life more than anything else
    given his portrayal, so it would be a stretch to say the center is a
    gathering of crack troops that are worthy to be even opponent to the Raiun
    of Gyou’un, not better (since the narrator already stated the Raiun is top
    of Shukai), but they can still be a challenge. Plus, they already got mad
    feats at Sanyou and Coalition:

    <h2>
      <b>Absolute Mobility</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Ousen’s core army has cavalry capable of traversing cliffs as shown in
    Coalition when he was saving Kankoku Pass. This is no trivial feat because
    so far only a few top-tier armies possess that skill like Riboku with his
    Ganmon cavalry, Kisui, and the Rigan bois, Karin, and her elite which is a
    contender for top 1-2 in Chu, Ouki’s elite.

    <h2>
      <b>Bottom Line</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    So to sum up the Ousen army at the center might not have commanders on the
    same calibre with AKou nor MaKou but that will be make up by Ousen himself
    plus very capable elite troops that is also versatile at all sort of combat
    style.
