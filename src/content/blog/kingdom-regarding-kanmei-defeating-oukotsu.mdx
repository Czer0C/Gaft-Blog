  <p>
    I don’t really think Kanmei told <strong>the whole story</strong> of that
    war with between Chu and Oukotsu. I mean, yes, the fact that they dueled is
    most likely not a lie, he managed to defeat Oukotsu, but was it really just
    that?

    His claim made Oukotsu looks like a real joke for someone who was among the
    rank of 6GG that all other states had to tremble in fear when seeing them.

    However, I personally think there was more to this than meets the eye.
    Remember that at that time, Kanmei was only a deputy to someone.

    This “someone”, or Kouen, had been hinted to be some sort of beast as well.
    Given how Karin treated Kanmei like trash but showed some sort of respect
    for him, plus the really hype title he got, I think he should be a
    formidable foe for Qin in some future conquest, just like how some figures
    at Zhao like SBS only got teaser this arc.

    Anyway, back to the point. I think Kouen was actually the main cause for
    Oukotsu’s defeat. Think about it, according to Kanmei, it was a war between
    2 states, with lots of soldiers, and it went like: 2 guys charged in and
    fight then it’s over. Lol, this sounds too fishy, ’cause no matter how you
    look at it, Oukotsu is still a 6 GG, he should have some advisors or
    strategists by his side like Kanki/Ouki/Ousen to back him up.
  </p>
  <p>
    The war on a GG scale aint just as simple as sending 2 commanders to fight,
    before that happened, a lots of detail must have been left out since Kanmei
    isn’t struck as a strategist or smart to me. Moreover, he probably didn’t
    think there was any need to spill the full story ’cause he was in a duel
    with Moubu, one that was going to decide the strongest among all of China.
    Therefore, rambling talk of the past was not an option, for not only did it
    not fit his character, there was also not the time for that. So, what can be
    concluded here?

  <p>
    Before Oukotsu fought Kanmei, something happened, like a huge scale strategy
    play between himself and Kouen, but Kouen got the upperhand and caught
    Oukotsu’s off-guard, which either lured or forced him into a duel with
    Kanmei then you got the result. For better visualization, you can treat it
    as something happened in the Coaltion war itself, when Moubu had to rely on
    Shouheikun to come up with a plan to draw Kanmei out.

  <p>
    So yeah all of this is purely my speculation but I also think this should
    justify Oukotsu who was one of Qin 6GGs as well as giving us some more hype
    for Kouen who will most likely be a real pain in the ass for the bois in the
    path of unification to come.
