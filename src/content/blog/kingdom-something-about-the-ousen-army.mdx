      <b>[SPOILERS WARNING]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    The Shukai Plain battle has been raging on for quite a long time and we got
    to know a tad more about the Ousen army, their performance on the
    battlefield have been arguably neat for a supporting role since this arc is
    meant for the trios to shine and carve their way to become general.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, that’s not really the topic here, but rather, there’s something
    unique and terrifying at the same time about the Ousen army, or to be more
    precise, <strong>how Ousen actually organizes and runs his army</strong>,
    and today I’m going to make an analysis of this matter.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      <strong>TL;DR</strong>: while most armies out there were built on{" "}
      <strong>the bonds between their leaders and subordinates</strong>, Ousen
      chooses to follow the <strong>principle of machinery</strong>, from{" "}
      <strong>the very top to the root of the system</strong>, with everyone
      having <strong>their own part to play</strong>, everything being{" "}
      <strong>strictly business, no sentiment</strong> involved, and when the
      time has come for them to leave the stage, another “piece” will come in to
      replace the vacancy and the machine is back to being functional again, and
      that is the nature of the Ousen army.
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>
      <b>The Commanders</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    First off let’s have a quick review of how Ousen’s subordinates have been
    portrayed:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>1.­ On the first day</strong>, MaKou used the "wave" strategy to
    push Kisui into a corner.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/fa9bb620-665d-4f3d-8444-9134a996da75.webp"
      alt=""
      height={1287}
      loading="lazy"
      width={1765}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    You’d think that this was his handiwork but I personally think that is not
    the case, and it was Ousen who came up with that or to be more specific,{" "}
    <strong>Ousen taught him that strategy</strong>.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-31.webp"
      alt=""
      height={356}
      loading="lazy"
      width={304}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>2. On the 9th day</strong>, AKou managed to stall 3 noticeable Zhao
    armies at the same time for a fair amount of duration:
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-32.webp"
      alt=""
      height={492}
      loading="lazy"
      width={640}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    And of course, it was Ousen’s defense strategy, one that even Riboku
    acknowledged.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-33.webp"
      alt=""
      height={924}
      loading="lazy"
      width={649}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    And it was pretty much stated that AKou is capable of precisely imitating
    some of Ousen’s strategies:
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-34.webp"
      alt=""
      height={486}
      loading="lazy"
      width={409}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Therefore it should be safe to assume that{" "}
    <strong>Ousen also taught AKou his own strategies</strong>.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-35.webp"
      alt=""
      height={544}
      loading="lazy"
      width={635}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    3. On the same aforementioned day, Gunei, AKou’s deputy, also revealed that
    he too can use some of Ousen’s trick, albeit not on the same level as AKou.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-36.webp"
      alt=""
      height={226}
      loading="lazy"
      width={313}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    On a side note, he first showed up at Sanyou so that means he’s been with
    Ousen for a very long time =&gt; <strong>lots of strategies learned</strong>.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-37.webp"
      alt=""
      height={616}
      loading="lazy"
      width={668}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>4. Lastly</strong>, ever since the demise of MaKou, Hara
    occasionally dropped a panel of Denrimi, who’s always shown to be next to
    Ousen.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-38.webp"

      height={612}
      loading="lazy"
      width={932}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Also doing some fancy analysis of the situation, and being used as a comedic
    relief with that Ousen mind-reading but ok let's get back on track.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-39.webp"
      alt=""
      height={817}
      loading="lazy"
      width={582}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    On the opening of the center clash, he proved himself to be a commander with
    lots of weird strategies at his disposal.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/605f65e3-abe0-44ce-b2fe-73db950375d8.webp"

      height={1287}
      loading="lazy"
      width={891}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    And there’s definitely more but the battle was interrupted so we could not
    get the full grasp of his real capability as a general, at least for now.
    However, following the pattern above, I don’t think it’s far-fetched to say
    that all of{" "}
    <strong>Denrimi also inherited these strategies from Ousen</strong>.{" "}
    <s>So Denrimi lowkey is Ousen’s best disciple</s>.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-41.webp"

    />
  </figure>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>The Structure</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    So what can be concluded from those portrayals? To me, unlike the
    Kanki/Ouki/Renpa/(insert any noticeable army name here) army which is pretty
    much diverse in some ways, the Ousen army is like a school full of
    disciplined and brain-washed students, who only know one thing and one thing
    only that is to <strong>follow exactly what Ousen says</strong> this is also
    backed by how the spies behaved at Gyou.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/bceed4e3-5654-4185-b0fb-8705f9987b46.webp"
      alt=""
      height={1287}
      loading="lazy"
      width={853}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Imagine, an army with a lot of commanders that can use Ousen’s strategies to
    some degree, strictly follow his order, <s>and gather no ambition</s>
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-43.webp"

  </figure>
  <p>
    Isn’t that just frightening? It’s like playing a game, you have a clan full
    of people using the same set of gears, the same skill tree, and the same
    technique as the top player in the team, sounds like a real pain to deal
    with huh?
  </p>
  <p>
    You can argue that it’s no fun and boring to play the game by following the
    same method, being uncreative and in the first place there’s no guarantee
    that it's the best approach since people can always come up with new ideas
    and the likes every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    But hey, I know this because I’ve been through before, lots of people would
    rather follow this indoctrinated way than starting everything from scratch
    and finding all the tricks of the game on their own because{" "}
    <strong>it’ll cost a lot of time</strong> and there’s also no guarantee that
    you can find a way to climb to the top this way, because, well, not everyone
    was borne a genius, no?
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>The Purpose</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    So back to the main point, Ousen <em>brainwashed </em>his entire army and
    shared his strategies with his commanders so they no longer have to spend
    their time needlessly in hope of creating new ones, because, obviously,{" "}
    <strong>
      war is not a game that you can grind for an unlimited amount of times to
      test out or come up with some new tricks, and that is
    </strong>
    <em>
      <em>
        if they are able to survive every single battle without a plot armor as
        thick as that of Heki.
      </em>
    </em>
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/644ac26f-f259-4988-88dc-00c90baccd25.webp"
      alt=""
      height={1536}
      loading="lazy"
      width={1521}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    So why bother doing the hard way when you already have a{" "}
    <em>
      <em>complete guidebook</em>
    </em>{" "}
    laid out by the Ousen who ranks really high on the leaderboard right now?
  </p>
  <p>
    And to be honest, this really fits the way Ousen{" "}
    <em>
      <em>has been collecting new </em>
    </em>
    <s>
      <em>
        <em>pokemon</em>
      </em>
    </s>
    <em>
      <em> talents like crazy</em>
    </em>
    .
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/cd6a45af-bbc5-4441-8c88-2f778bf20ad2.webp"

      height={942}
      loading="lazy"
      width={1267}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    This is not because he is interested in what they have in store, but because
    of the chance that{" "}
    <strong>
      they’ll understand his strategies better than ordinary commanders
    </strong>
    , thus making them more efficient on the battlefield, by his way, <strong>
      just so he can manipulate the chessboard to his own will
    </strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, a general who excels in martial art now only need care about
    just one thing, that is to hone their fighting skill to the pinnacle and
    come drop by Ousen’s personal classroom once a while to cram up new
    strategies, and tadaa,{" "}
    <strong>we got a general who can utilize both brain</strong>:<br />
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/image-46.webp"
      alt=""
      height={408}
      loading="lazy"
      width={375}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>And brawl alike</strong>:
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"

      alt=""
      height={924}
      loading="lazy"
      width={652}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Even further than that, the scariest thing about this method of building an
    army is the fact that{" "}
    <strong>Ousen has absolutely no concern for his fallen commanders</strong>,
    as they can be easily replaced by those that he has recruited from various
    campaigns.
  </p>

    <h2>
      <b>Bottom Line</b>

  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      To wrap all this up, while most armies out there were built on{" "}

      that is the nature of the Ousen army.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    One last thing to add, for what purpose did Ousen decide to shape his army
    like that? I guess you already have the answer ever since his introduction.{" "}
