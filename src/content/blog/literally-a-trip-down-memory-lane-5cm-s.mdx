    <h3>
      <b>[SPOILERS WARNING]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    It’s been like 3 years since I got to know of Makoto Shinkai through his
    most iconic work: 5cm/s, and damn, looking back I sure have come a long way.
    I gotta admit though, Shinkai is really a magician of emotion, capable of
    playing with the audience’s mind through visual tricks and his surreal
    romanticism.
  </p>
  <p>
    But anyway that isn’t really the topic this time. When I completed 5cm/s for
    the first time, I told myself that I’d never revisit this anime, not because
    it’s too sad but for fear of being incapable of “feeling” it again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some stories are meant to “hit” you just once, since the moment you learned
    of the twist or outcome unless you brainwashed yourself out of that part,
    you can never get that powerful sense of emotion rushing into your mind
    again. However, 5cm/s has probably proven me wrong in this regard.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 3 years timespan might seem huge but I’ll be honest, I had barely
    forgotten any major turning point of the anime, they were still as clear as
    daylight, yet I could not help but emerge myself in that similar
    rollercoaster trip as I did back then when rewatching 5cm/s.

  <p>
    The story started off with a pretty standard premise, 2 childhood friends
    going through some hardship (but not really, it’s pretty cute when I look at
    a slightly different angle in fact), and slowly but surely developed an
    intimate relationship as time flew. However, what really sets up the mood
    and impact is the “atmosphere”.
  </p>
  <p>
    Immediately upon the introduction, we’d be hit with a lot of symbolism and
    not-so-subtle foreshadowing of what to come in the late game. Frankly, even
    if you’re a heartless person that gives no crap to romance and the likes,
    I’m sure you’d still be impressed or at least entertained by such a powerful
    opening sequence of the anime.

  <p>
    No matter how I look at it, the way the first 2 main characters were
    presented gave hint to a big “NOPE” regardless of how hard they struggled
    through their predicament (I mean, the way Akari casually went ahead and
    left Takaki behind, the interrupting train
    <s>, heck even the title itself is already a major spoiler</s>), thus making
    the anime the more “tragic” in its own way.
  </p>
  <p>
    One common trend that mostly all Shinkai’s works share is{" "}
    <em>
      <em>
        <strong>“distance” between individuals</strong>
      </em>
    </em>
    . Not always taken literally, it can also entail figurative meaning behind all
    those interactions, conveyed through the characters’ emotion, thoughts, or just
    a simple stare. To me, this is probably Shinkai’s strongest asset among his skillset,
    and 5cm/s is definitely the prime example of this theme.

  <p>
    In my opinion, 5cm/s peaked in the first chapter,{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>absolutely no bias</em>
      </em>
    </strong>{" "}
    involved <s>(no I really meant it)</s>. I mean, the dialogue, the
    inner-thought, the interaction, the visual effect and sound (basically tons
    of moments felt very{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>real</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    , like the sound of heavy snow being stepped on, or a train arriving under the
    most desperate situation), all of them were woven so masterfully together in
    order to “paint” the full “picture” that Shinkai envisioned in his mind, that’s
    just something.

    Even if I disregard plot, that climax under the tree was so spot on, my long
    lost sense of empathy finally rose again to fully embrace that majestic yet
    tragic moment of the anime (for real, the way the 2 of them were “separated”
    felt very forced and fuck no they should have been together for all fucking
    time, k I’m done salting).

    The farewell was also really well handled. I mean I’ve been kinda in a
    similar situation before so it hit me the more here but damn, that regretful
    look from Akari really got me there, again,{" "}

    it legit gave me goosebumps.

  <p>
    In all seriousness I’m really proud of Akari, like whew, small and fragile
    but not without such steadfastness, you sure can melt the heart of the most
    stone-cold out there, way to go my girl.

    While the 2nd chapter feels not as strong as the first one, it did give me
    some food for thought as well as a bit of chill thanks to the superb scenery
    and setting. I mean I always dream of living a casual life in a noise-less,
    tranquil, and not-so-densely populated place, mostly to get peace of mind
    and run away from all the burden and trouble in my life.

    Anyway again, “distance” was also focused on in this chapter, albeit not
    literally. The 2 main characters are always seen together, yet they’re so
    “far away”. The boy, Takaki, could still hardly rid himself of the past,
    constantly deluding of a paradise land with his loved one (gosh this is a
    bit indescribable but why it’s so filled with a sense of fucking “regret”).

    On the other hand, the girl, Sumida can never get to convey her feeling to
    her crush despite having gained herself proper motivation and perhaps
    excuse. What really hit home here is the fact that Takaki never saw Sumida
    as anything “close” to him, other than a friend or maybe sister lmao.

  <p>
    Some say Takaki indirectly caused a detrimental blow to Sumida and while I
    don’t have anything against that, it’s just inevitable. It’s not like he
    really meant it that way, just that the “past” resides too deeply inside him
    so RIP, don’t blame the guy.

    The highlight of this chapter is probably when the 2 characters gazed into a
    launching NASDA rocket and they each came to their own{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>answer</em>
      </em>

    , thus born another “tragic” romantic outcome.

  <p>
    All things must come to an end, and the final chapter is simply a fitting
    conclusion to this gloomy romantic tale. Just as I thought it could not get
    any more depressing, Shinkai be like “psst, what about a{" "}
    <strong>bit more</strong> but from <strong>both </strong>sides”.

    Like wow, not only did Takaki lead a slightly fucked and aimless life (RIP

    dramatic revelation about her “path”.

    Yeah, I know it doesn’t change much, it was clear from the get-go that these
    2 would never be together, but cmonbruh, do you have to be that savage, it
    feels like getting hit by an earthquake and then tsunami in quick succession
    as your house’s right next to the sea lmao.

    That being said, I think the final cut kind of give off a small ray of hope
    in Takaki’s future, as he didn’t appear bitter but instead showed a sense of
    relief and finally got the strength to move on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same can also be applied to Akari but I wish we literally had a
    narrative of her side as she had so much potential (ahem, absolutely not
    bia… ok I’m stopping now).

    Phew, it’s been quite a while since I’ve rambled on this much. The truth is
    that, during my rewatching 5cm/s, though I had tried to suppress it, the
    nostalgia of my own glorious past just kept submerging in my mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s not like I’m still attached to any of that but yeah it just is like
    that, made me end up thinking about pointless stuff in the good ol’ days.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyhow, I’ve always held some doubts about my opinion on Shinkai’s works but
    this little trip down the memory lane (both literally and figuratively)
    pretty much solidified my appreciation of this whimsical director.
