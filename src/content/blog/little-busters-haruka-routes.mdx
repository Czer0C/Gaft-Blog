      <b>[SPOILERS ALERT]</b>
    </h3>

  <p>
    <strong>TLDR</strong>: decent route with likable characters but not without
    a lot of bumps yet somehow managed to land safely at the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    Can't believe I have not touched a single Visual Novel since the beginning
    of the year. (well, Baldr Sky kinda doesn't count since I started reading it
    at the end of 2020 ðŸ˜‚)
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyhow, though the journey has only just begun and there's a long way ahead,
    I still decided to write something about Little Busters!, or to be more
    specific, it's the <strong>Haruka route</strong> that piqued my interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    To be extremely blunt, Haruka's route has some intriguing concepts and{" "}
    <em>tries </em>to be different with a daring approach compared to Key's
    usual works{" "}
    <s>(or maybe I just haven't spent enough time on their other titles)</s>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, there is some good ol' fashioned twin sister debacle which pretty
    much is a specialty of Key and something that I tend to have a soft spot for
    (Muv-luv, Higurashi, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, they even went as far as digging deep into the "ugly" side of
    certain characters, which I find rather compelling as substances for a
    story.
  </p>

  <p>
    That said, the elephant in the room is undoubtedly the poorly structured
    plot device regarding the <strong>stupid family tradition </strong>crap that
    can't be taken seriously, whether from a practical or fictional standpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    For once, it's downright <strong>abused </strong>to incite melodrama and
    make way for the <strong>"nobody's in the wrong" </strong>card, which can
    get rather annoying or cringe-worthy even.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, I can't stress enough how{" "}
    <strong>awfully convenient</strong> and dumb the double husband fuckery is
    lol.
    <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, it's a very stereotypical forced drama. And have I mentioned the{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>"BaLaNcE bEtWeEn HaPiNeSs AnD MiSfOrTuNe"</em>
    </strong>{" "}
    propaganda bs lmao.

  <p>
    Despite the resounding complaints, I don't mean to say it{" "}
    <em>completely </em>ruined my experience for this route or LB as a whole,
    for even amidst that chaos, they did bring up some nice themes such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learning to be</li>
    <li>
      A bootleg version of "<em>Without love, it cannot be seen" </em>(Umineko)
    </li>
    <li>Being considerate isn't always a good thing</li>
    <li>Twin-ish dilemma</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Speaking of twins, the{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>key </em>
    </strong>
    characters (no pun intended) involved in this route are also well polished with
    sufficient development throughout the ride.

    Yet again, thanks to the <strong>not-so wholesome</strong> plot, they, as
    the center of this route, were responsible for some seriously{" "}
    <em>unbearable </em>segments full of cringe and retardism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sorry for being a broken record, but man...both Haruka and Kanata have quite
    a lot of issues that considerably <em>dampened the flow of the story</em> to
    me.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, Haruka struck me as a fun and easy-going person, which is the{" "}
    <strong>
      main reason why I got invested in this route in the first place
    </strong>
    , but boi, I almost regretted that during the ride ðŸ˜‚. I mean, she can be a comedic
    factor to a group, but I can hardly take her <strong>
      random charade
    </strong> seriously.

    Meanwhile, Kanata has a <strong>total disaster of an introduction</strong>{" "}
    because I lost count of the time{" "}
    <em>I literally wanted to punch her to the face</em>, but again, who could
    have seen that for real, and
    <strong> the table turned ridiculously fast </strong>as a result (which will
    be elaborated in a bit).

      <em>My thoughts exactly</em>

  </figure>
  <p>
    Anyway, what I'm trying to say is as everything slowly unveiled, it all
    added up and <em>kinda justify their behaviors</em> (I'm still a bit mad
    about the plot device though), so I guess they are not too bad as characters
    overall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like damn, the<strong> late-game interaction</strong> is just something
    pleasingly cathartic I'd say. Apart from that, the{" "}
    <strong>self-conflict</strong> within each of them was pretty well put, be
    it in a directed manner or saturated with nuances.

  <p>
    Now, I'm aware that my reactions to the characters and story appear to be
    rather <strong>extreme</strong>, but those were my honest feelings for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nonetheless, do keep in mind that my opinion regarding the subjects in
    question did change in the end, and I see them in a more{" "}
    <strong>positive </strong>light now, at least for the characters that is.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean yeah, they can be absolutely annoying or dumb or whatever negative
    term you wanna use, but for some reason,
    <em> I got used to that in time </em>and even grew to like them more.

    It was <strong>12 am</strong> while I marathoned my way through to climax,
    and the finish line was crossed at roughly <strong>3 am. </strong>This is
    but a rare occurrence, even back in my most active days of binge-reading VN.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless, the resolution near the end feels a bit <strong>rushed </strong>
    and <strong>convoluted, </strong>but given Haruka's position in the <em>
      heroine hierarchy
    </em> (you get the idea), I guess it can't be helped.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, a funny thing is that while{" "}
    <em>
      Haruka was the one thing that got me curious the most in the beginning
    </em>
    , at the end of her route, <strong>
      Kanata easily took up that mantle
    </strong>, and I think I'm going to have a pretty rough time carving my path
    through LB till her route is unlocked ðŸ˜­ (4 more routes + Refrain to finish bruh).
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, I'm not saying that Haruka or the other girls are bad (at least
    for now), but damn Kanata is really just something. She basically{" "}
    <strong>ticks most of the box</strong> for me when it comes to this kind of
    story, so welp.
