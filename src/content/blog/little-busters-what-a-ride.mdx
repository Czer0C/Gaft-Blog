  <p>
    If you are familiar with Key and some of their titles beforehand, then you
    should not be surprised to see how Little Busters rolls. However, I dare to
    say this is Key's finest work so far. Yep, it's better than the esteemed
    Clannad, though not like the gap is that big.

    That is not to say this game is flawless by all means. On the contrary, it's
    downright juvenile, and, ironically, despite "Little" being part of the
    title, they tend to blow things out of proportion for some seriously
    ridiculous or trivial reasons. But you know what, it just works, at least to
    me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm way past the point of getting mad or sweating the small details, and if
    you just let those <em>little</em> bumps slide along the way, the whole
    story is a lot more enjoyable and entertaining than how it looks.

    The core theme of LB is rather simple (friendship), yet the tradeoff is the
    fact that it remained <strong>consistent </strong>from the start till the
    end.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, I'm still most impressed at the direction taken at Haruka's route
    since it was an oddly bold decision of Key to derail from their usual pure
    and innocent "image". I did go out of my way to write a{" "}
    <a href="https://gaftonosh.com/little-busters-haruka-routes/">post</a> about
    that route, so not going to dive deep into it here.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a different note, world-building (routing system included) is a bit
    ambitious, and I legit find this aspect to be the most wasted potential as
    it does have room for further expansion and maybe even epic showdowns, but
    that's probably too much to fit in Key's mindset.

    The cast, on the other hand, is a rag-tag bunch ranging from being dumb fun
    (glaring at Haruka), down-to-earth wholesome-ish, and straight-up raw swag
    kino (Kanata supremacy, period).
  </p>
  <p>
    What's more, the character interactions feel organic and dynamic, not just
    from the <em>usual suspects</em> but also those who are deceptively out of
    the loop, which is a plus to me.

    As a heads-up, though, there will be plenty of casual slice-of-life and,
    bluntly put, non-sensical segments when you get started with the story.
    Still, as mentioned above, this is pretty much a tradition of Key, so it's
    most likely inevitable ü§∑‚Äç. In other words, be prepared for the worst if
    you're not a fan of this kind of content (glad I didn't have to üòÇ)

    Next up, the sound design is solid overall, and the OSTs featured throughout
    the game are pretty lit (the OP is the best). But damn, some of the ambient
    tracks just seamlessly blend in with the atmosphere of certain scenes that
    almost tricked me into thinking that I was reading a fantasy story.

    Almost forgot though. The voice acting in LB is pretty superb, be it male or
    female characters, since they all suffered near-zero performance issues,
    which is just something.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, my bias view is inclined to believe that Suzuki Keiko, the VA
    of Futaki Kanata and Saigusa Haruka, deserves a gold medal for her
    extraordinary effort, as she totally killed it by capturing the emotions,
    demeanors, and nuances of the twin sisters, thus further accentuate the
    dramatic revelation at the climax of their story. How should I put this, it
    feels, oddly enough, very real, genuine, and transparent as the
    conversations or monologues persisted.

    Apart from that, the CGs are decent, I guess . However, some shots felt a
    bit redundant or instead could have used a different angle to make full use
    of their purpose but whatever.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only complaint I have in this regard is the awkwardly{" "}
    <strong>huge eye </strong>design for the characters because they feel
    ludicrous and even distracting lol (which is, again, a Key's specialty so
    ü§∑‚Äç)

    Gameplay-wise, LB does offer some wacky mini-game in between the storyline,
    which can be hit-or-miss from how I see it. Personally, while I don't find
    this element to be that very engaging, it does slightly contribute to
    polishing character interactivity in general, so yeah, not too terrible if I
    have to be honest.

    In a nutshell, Little Busters is a solid VN for those who don't mind SoL and
    dumb-fun stuff. And even if it might not live up to your expectation, you
    sure as hell can expect some good laugh or wholesome moments out of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    P/S: though there are 3 EX routes left to finish, I figured they are not
    going to affect my opinion on the game as a whole much so I just went ahead
    and wrote a quick review for Little Busters right after the end credit of
    Refrain.
