      <b>[SPOILERS WARNING]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    No for real, I’m aware that Lyrical is definitely not your typical Magical
    Girl show given how SS1 played through. But sweet mother of mercy, they
    literally went all out without a shred of hesitation in the next
    installment. From world-building, plot, characters, sound, to animation,
    everything intertwined so well together that I could hardly find a spot to
    complain (ok that’s a lie bc it was more like I was getting carried away by
    the heat of the show but still).
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyhow, I think I’m getting ahead of myself. Since I’m a bit burned out
    lately from having to tackle so many problems at the same time, I’d just
    settle with a quick episode analysis. While the last 2 episodes were well
    done in many ways, 8 remains my top pick due to the amount of “kino” reside
    within.

      <b>Fate – Resist The Irresistible</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    What can I say, even though this anime came out first, I could not help but
    think about a{" "}
    <em>
      <em>similar</em>
    </em>{" "}
    situation in <strong>TTGL</strong>, which is just incredible because it
    doesn’t fall too short behind in terms of thematic value as well as
    execution. While I much prefer Nanoha’s development in SS1, Fate simply made
    a spectacular comeback with this single moment alone.

    I mean the atmosphere is just so surreal that made me almost feel like it’d
    be better to let Fate took the <strong>blue pill</strong>. However, the
    answer for this debacle was clear from the get-go, and the concluding moment
    featuring Alicia is just heart-wrenching to witness.

      <b>Nanoha - Unwavering Soul</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    While Nanoha might not have the best development, I still enjoy her moments
    thanks to the insane action-packed with beautiful wide-view shots for a
    change of pace after relatively lengthy conversation or closed-up scenes.
    Just simply looking at the weapon design makes me even wonder if I’m really
    watching a magical girl anime lol.

    Apart from that, though there seems to be a repetitive pattern of Nanoha’s
    resolution, it doesn’t bore me in the slightest because the girls are still
    very young, so it makes sense for them to be naive, no, remains positive
    about the world and their surroundings, which pretty much counters the
    depressing overtone of this season.

      <b>Hayate - Beyond Master And Servant</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    With most people prefer Fate’s struggle in this episode, I should be in the
    minority for being wholeheartedly invested in the grand revelation of Hayate
    and Reinforcer. I believe I’ve said this before but again, this kind of
    master-servant relationship can easily get on my soft spot and thus I’m left
    with no choice but{" "}
    <em>
      <em>aaaaaaa</em>
    </em>
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>AAAAAA</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    after getting to this part.

    I mean this moment right here is basically the accumulation of Reinforcer’s
    story, a being that was red-herring to be some sort of secondhand WoRlD
    DeStRuCtIoN villain which turned out to have a heart, soul, and a fiery
    motivation behind her action as well.

    It is true that this kinda came out of nowhere but if you pay attention from
    the start, everything adds up, from how Hayate first made contact with the
    tome, how there is a not-so-detail story behind the Wolkenritter, or simply
    the connection and tie between its members. What I also like about
    Reinforcer is how she didn’t have to say or explain or justify her action
    whatsoever since it has all been laid out via her not-so-subtle facial
    expression, manner, and tone, which IMO is top tier execution.

    It was at this moment that I finally came to appreciate the grand scheme of
    things in Lyrical A’s. In the beginning, it appeared to be a giant mess of
    random bits being thrown in together to create suspense and the likes, but
    slowly and surely everything came into place and thus complete the big
    picture. AND HOLY SHIT THE MUSIC JUST DELIVERS.

  <p>
    Simply put, Nanoha Lyrical A or SS2 is a huge step-up from its previous
    instance, which totally blew my mind away as I neither expected it to be
    this grandiose and paid off at the same time, and episode 8 is easily the
    peak of this anime to me.
