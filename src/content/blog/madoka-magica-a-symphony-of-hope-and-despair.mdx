    Adolescence is probably one of the most influential periods in our lifetime.
    It is at this stage<em> </em>that we got to experience firsthand all sorts
    of different emotions such as love, envy, hate, or even despair. And Madoka
    Magica held no punch in taking full advantage of this theme given how the
    setting is also very compatible.

    The story is very captivating if I have to be honest. There are no doubt
    some problems with this regard such as expositions that felt very contrived
    and awfully convenient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nonetheless, the general idea was very meaningful and packed with a lot of
    substance such as a powerful cast and dramatic revelation to further enhance
    the experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some plot twists were cleverly disguised in the form of cheesy, cutesy
    pretense, which is pretty commendable given the contrast the show was trying
    to depict.

    That being said, my biggest complaint is that at some point Gen was trying
    so hard to impose his ideal on the audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best example of this case is how the characters and plot all seem to be
    adamant that ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù must always balance out to maintain the order
    of the universe.

      For the record, I‚Äôm not totally against this concept, for it bears a great

    The character of the anime is definitely its strongest point. I
    wholeheartedly enjoy every single one, from the main cast, the supporting,
    to the supposed ‚Äúantagonist‚Äù.
  </p>
  <p>
    For one thing, they are not without flaws, but damn, I can‚Äôt find any
    annoyance about that, to be honest. I have to give some props to Gen for
    managing to balance out the characters well in a relatively short series.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of the main girls carries their own ideals and has neat development
    from their introduction to their closure.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Madoka: while mostly appears to be helpless, she is kind and observative.
      Her ideal took some serious build-up to be revealed but IMO it was worth
      it in the end.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <figcaption>Whew</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sayaka: a typical naive young girl who seems to be the most fitting
      character at the beginning only turned out to be the biggest punching bag
      of the show. I must say she was really well handled, but that‚Äôs a given
      because Gen Butcher just ‚Äúenjoys‚Äù this kind of character a lot.
    </li>

      Mami: a very nice person on the surface but deep inside she has her own
      doubt and problems as well, very nicely portrayed indeed.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <figcaption>That scenery</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Kyouko: probably the best girl to me. She had a rough start and appeared
      to be beyond redeemable but managed to have a spectacular comeback at the
      late game. Her theme is most likely ‚Äúindependence‚Äù or ‚Äúsolitude‚Äù which I
      can somewhat resonate with as well.
    </li>

    <figcaption>Arghhhhh</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Homura: the star player of the show, no doubt the most developed and
      fleshed-out character. I like her a lot despite her being a bit edgy
      sometimes. But in the grand scheme of things, it‚Äôs justified and not big
      of a deal. I think her theme is learning to let go or move on, but yeah,
      that‚Äôs up to how you interpret her story.

    What I really like about this part is the diverse interactions between the
    main cast. In the beginning, one might think they‚Äôd stay like this forever,
    but as the story progresses, so do their relationships. They could be
    friends, they could be enemies, or even neither at the same time.

    On another note, MadoMom managed to catch my attention a great many times as
    well. As a supporting character, she did her job well in providing a
    different view of some of the problems and not without some funny or comfy
    interaction with Madoka.

    Kyuubey is quite a debatable character. Some say he‚Äôs entirely evil. Some
    argue that it was not his intention and was justified given the way his kind
    was portrayed. Personally, for me, he falls into that kind of ‚ÄúI understand
    why you‚Äôre an ass, but you‚Äôre still ass in the end‚Äù.

    For real, it‚Äôs like when you sign a contract, and they didn‚Äôt point out the
    significant terms. Not until things went south did you get to learn the
    truth about everything. Logically speaking, it was our fault, but he was
    also responsible for trying to ‚Äúevade‚Äù the issue.

    Animation-wise, Madoka Magica truly was a bomb for 2011. I mean, it‚Äôs not
    perfect in every way, there are some serious inconsistencies with the design
    and animation, but overall, I was still fascinated by it in the end.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">

  <p>
    The sublime background is one thing but what defines Madoka Magica‚Äôs art is
    its peculiar, out-of-this-world style, especially when it comes to fighting
    sequences. A bit of light-hearted mixing dark and grim tone is a clever way
    to illustrate the world of Madoka, as it also goes well with the main theme
    and atmosphere of the anime.

    That being said, there exists a minor issue being the awkward pacing when it
    comes to this. Some fights were great but some felt like it was dragging on
    a lot to ‚Äúshow off‚Äù their animation skill or something which kinda backfired
    tbh because I wanted to focus on what was going on instead of being
    distracted by pointless motion. It‚Äôs not a big deal in the end but yeah
    there‚Äôs that to take into account.

    The directing is brilliant anyhow. In particular, characters‚Äô expressions
    were made full use to avoid needless wordy conversation. Additionally, some
    symbolism was nicely placed to further amplify the atmosphere, thus
    resulting in powerful shots during the ride.

    Lastly, the sound is one of the best things Madoka Magica has to offer. From
    the astonishing ED to the moe-bait OP and the battle themes, not a single
    one of them was wasted to complete the orchestra of hope and despair in
    Madoka Magica. Voice acting is also on point, I enjoy Sayaka‚Äôs voice in this
    regard, for she was probably the one who underwent the most emotional
    transitions and the Seiyuu did not fail to deliver.

  <p>
    The bottom line is, Madoka Magica managed to bring forth a rare breed of
    Magical Girl show. The ‚Äúdark‚Äù tone under cutesy pretense was a bold move.
    Even if you have already anticipated that it is still backed by a solid
    cast, splendid animation, and uplifting music. Had I not found the plot
    intriguing, I would have still been entertained regardless. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs
    not the first of its kind, but it has high production value and delivers
    quite a performance despite the flaws mentioned above.
