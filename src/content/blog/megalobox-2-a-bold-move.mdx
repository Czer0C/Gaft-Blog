    Welcome to Megalobox 2, the land of shades (even in sunless places for some
    reason), drugs, depression, wonky science, bird symbolism, and, of course,
    highly intense boxing with a bit of "sprinkles" on top.

    I mean, I was told that this season would head towards a different direction
    compared to its predecessor but for real, I totally couldn't anticipate such
    dramatic shifts of atmosphere. In fact, I legit had no clue how they would
    plan to expand the story any further given how satisfyingly conclusive SS1's
    ending was.
  </p>
  <p>
    But you know what, I'm always up for something daring, transparent, and
    gimmick-free, hence, I must say that Megalobox 2 nailed almost everything.
    Yes, "almost".
  </p>
  <p>
    While it is true that I got caught up in an endless stream of hype,
    excitement, and a bit of manly emotional moments in M2, the amount of
    problem it propagates is, sadly, something I cannot overlook.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I have to describe M2 in one word, it would be "over-saturated" (which is
    both a good and bad thing).
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-06-27-11_56_43-Greenshot-1.webp"

      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    First thing first, the positive side. M2 focuses on polishing its
    world-building and refining the whole cast in many ways. I mean, the fancy
    boxing is still there, but at the same time, you get to see many different
    sides of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If SS1 followed the typical "reaching for the top" plotline, the
    consequences it has on anyone who dares to harbor this thought are
    manifested in SS2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Admittedly, it is a very commendable move from the creator. From the way,
    the narrative was handled to a simple gesture or behavior of the characters
    and without the need of lengthy conversation whatsoever, the audience can
    immediately notice their thought process or struggle.

    Nonetheless, what surprises me more is how well the cast was taken care of.
    Not only do the old line-up get decent development (not without flaws tho,
    will explain in a bit), the newly introduced ones are also treated with
    solid consideration and meticulous planning to give them a chance of
    catching up with the main cast.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be more specific, there is foreshadowing from the start and a variety of
    dynamic interactions between the newcomers and the veterans to make the most
    out of their screentime, which is a pretty smart move from the creator, an
    easy win-win scenario.

      "Chief" is probably the best character to me but damn this anime is just
      stacked with major badasses

  </figure>
  <p>
    Apart from that, M2 doesn't shy away from exploring some of the most
    "negative" themes in competition and the likes namely depression,
    self-sabotage, internal conflict, and <em>chasing an unreachable star</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though I cannot say this works all the time, and even if the story can get
    very <strong>predictable </strong>at some points all thanks to the classic
    tropes being put together, fact remains that this approach is a perfect
    match for the art style and tone that the Megalo series had decided on from
    the get-go.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-06-26-23_24_42-Greenshot.webp"

      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    That is not to say this series is devoid of "hope" whatsoever. The thing is
    that behind every man's action lies a powerful and totally reasonable drive
    that pushes them to the utmost limit.
  </p>
  <p>
    And just as I mentioned above, though this is partly predictable and cliche,
    it doesn't quite overwrite any of the negative overtones as stated earlier,
    but more so going in tandem with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, the characters are not dependent on plot, and are "free" to move
    at their own pace, which is very cool and rarely seen in any kind of media
    let alone anime.

    Now to the main complaints, though M2 worked hard to compensate its
    individual element by giving them a purpose or meaning, it only serves to
    backfire and result in quite of a wobbly mess when looking at a big picture.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, why bother over-complicate the story to a generic evil
    corporation plot that barely has anything to do with what the series is
    about.

    I mean don't get me wrong, I'm aware of what it is trying to achieve here,
    by showing that there are "consequences", there ought to be some trade-off
    when something positive happened.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, just because there are consequences doesn't automatically make it a
    compelling development. I'd much preferred if they maintained the initial
    "you got your motivation and so do I <s>then somebody dies</s>" kind of
    resolution instead of "let them fight for all I care why I'm pulling a 5D
    chess move behind the scene" 🤦‍
  </p>

  <p>
    Not only that, often time I would find myself wondering why some of the
    characters even get this much attention even though they don't contribute
    much to the plot or, worse, attribute to rather cringe-worthy expositions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, I'm aware of the fact that they're trying to give these characters
    some substance as a way to fine-tune their role in the story, but sadly not
    all of them had the right material so it only did the opposite, at least
    that's how I see it.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be even more specific, "rational hatred" is arguably my least favorite
    approach when it comes to orchestrating a drama, so welp.

  <p>
    All said and done, I think M2 is still a very solid watch despite some of
    the issues that hindered my experience to certain degrees. Perhaps it's
    because not every season can you find an anime with a pretty unique style on
    top of pulling no punch in its brutal storytelling. If anything, the
    constant display of manly conversations and over-the-top hyped sequences are
    more than enough to cater to my need.
