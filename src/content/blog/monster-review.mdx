Took the opportunity to re-read Monster because I wanted to test reading experience on my new iPad Pro, and it turned out a lot better than expected. I've finished Monster long ago and was not very impressed by it, but now I think I have missed out on some detail that basically changed my opinion on the manga overall.

While I still prefer Pluto from the big works of Naoki, I think the idea behind Monsters is far simpler yet just as powerful.

What makes a monster? Does monster really exist? These have been recurring themes throughout the story and I think given the release year it has also served to be an inspiration for many other manga, anime or even movie that came out later.

While it's undeniable that the mysteries and detective elements remain the core of this work, I find the result and application of said factors are what made Monster captivating, as the whole purpose of uncovering the truth behind the puzzles were to understand, and symphathize with the victims as well as the perpetrator. I'd have to quote Umineko for this one, "it's not about the what and how, it's about the why". And damn boy they really nailed it with this one.

In response to the main subject of the manga, I'd also like add my few cents on the topic. What makes a monster? I think anything can. Because as demonstrated in this work, even the most kind-hearted, down to earth person can "slip" and turn into something out of their character GIVEN THE BADLY TIMED circumstances and envinroment surround them. This is of course not to justify their terrible deeds, but to understand and accept it is for what it is.

The cast of Monster can be hailed as rich and quite engaging, the only problem I can point out is the lack of presence and screentime for the twin even though they have their status as main character. For Johan sure his reach in the manga without even being metaphorical is just completely over the top, but I don't really enjoy the fact that most of the time his presence is simply people retelling a story or reminisicing about the past or yada yada, not real actual onscreen time, so I think he can be greatly improved even further had the author come up with some way to achieve that. But even so I'm not as mad for Johan than I am for Nina, she's just so wasted and barely left any mark on the story other than being merely a shadow to Johan. I know it's unfair to compare the two of them but hey if Naoki decided to have them as twin with so much similarity in design and such then I just can't help it, also her early stage was actually pretty well done and I enjoyed her moments till she got swiftly reduced to being a mere plot device so yea, that's just rip.

I may be a bit harsh on this matter but this is a price to pay for having an ambitious lineup of character, sure it's a challenge to balance between main and supporting if you have way too many of them but I think for a work as grandiose as Monster it was totally capable of setting a clear line between them, not just as having Tenma alone as main focus. Regardless, I really enjoyed a lot of those characters individually, they served their purpose well and brought flavors to the story as the plot got thicker while enclosing the finish line, which is very cool.

The art direction for this manga is just great I can say. Naoki usually strives for a realistic approach for his works and I don't have anything against it, this makes a good change of pace from the majority of 2d where everything steer away from real life and go as wild, weird and fantasy-like as possible. The choice for setting is also great because I don't think we've got that many series that actually deeply involved german and EU as monster did and the culture change is nice to see. Apart from that Naoki also made full use of the advantage of manga as a medium to create atmospheric shots especially when transiting from a gloomy, desolate view to something more hopeful but also unclear, thus evoking a rather serene mood. And the way the manga work, with every page you turn , you can't be sure if it'll be another jump scare or something heartfelt, disgusting or simply mesmerizing.

All and all, I think Monster was a very good read and while it has room for improvement the main message and theme was well delivered in a very sophisticated way over the course of 140+ chapters as the curtain on the large picture being taken off bits by bits. Accompanying the manga is a prolific amount of characters treated with care and capable of moving on their own pace on top of the beautiful manga shot to highlight dramatic moments or simply for inducing a breathless scene after a long period of getting you on edge with its seemingly never ending chase for the darkness
