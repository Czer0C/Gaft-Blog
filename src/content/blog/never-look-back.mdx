    <strong>
      There will be spoilers so best avoid this post unless you have already
      finished Umineko
    </strong>
    ]
  </p>
  <p>
    Ushiromiya Ange is a hidden protagonist from the Umineko franchise, and she
    plays quite a pivotal role in the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Naturally, as someone who has a considerable amount of screentime,{" "}
    <em>
      there ought to be hit-or-miss moments that either win her the audience’s
      affection or incite their hate.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    According to some people, Ange can be rather{" "}
    <strong>ignorant, stubborn, and idiotic</strong> during the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite my strong feelings toward Ange,{" "}
    <em>I cannot deny the times when she got on my nerves</em>, albeit not as
    much as an issue compared to some maddened readers.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, given Ange’s self-centered personality and slightly rude
    manner, I don’t blame people for being annoyed by her.

  <p>
    However<em>, that is just taking the context for granted here.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, Ange underwent one of, if not, the most extreme upbringing of all
    the cast in Umineko. Yes, Yasu’s circumstance was no better, but to be fair,
    there was still Kinzo to play the favoritism card. Meanwhile, Ange was
    totally on her own for almost <strong>12 years</strong>, physical abuse,
    mental breakdown, you name it.
  </p>
  <p>
    They often say people’s personalities are{" "}
    <em>
      <em>influenced </em>
    </em>
    by the environment surrounding them, which cannot be more factual in this scenario.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is not to say this makes a fair excuse for Ange to misbehave herself in
    front of many people. I’m just saying that sometimes you gotta look at
    things from many perspectives to understand why things turned out that way,
    oops, a shameless Umineko reference.
  </p>

  <p>
    In all honesty, there is hardly anything wrong with a poorly brought-up
    individual having bad attitudes most of the time. Though Ange might have
    been sent to a prestigious institution, context matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eva made sure that she was <strong>completely isolated</strong> from any
    contact, thus resulting in an absolute “cage” to restrain any healthy
    development for Ange’s growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a different note, her insistence on reaching the “truth” is perfectly
    normal to me. I don’t understand why some people really felt the need to
    shut her down completely from getting the one thing that she desired the
    most in her entire life.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      Yes, the “truth” is terrible, disgusting even, but that is coming from us{" "}
      <strong>WHO HAVE ALREADY KNOWN</strong> the full picture, whereas Ange was
      still in the dark about it. For one thing, what matters is whether Ange
      learned anything from her “rollercoaster” ride to the Golden Land.
    </p>
  </div>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide">
    <img

  <p>
    If anything, it was all worthwhile the effort and setback that had arisen.
    For someone who had virtually lost everything in her life, giving up herself
    to learn the truth was most definitely the only way to give her life a
    purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    Living is not the same as{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>being kept alive</em>
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    During the 12 harsh years under Eva’s guardianship, Ange was isolated,
    completely stripped from any human rights that she deserved. Therefore,
    Ange’s adventure to the Golden Land was truly a time that she was most{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>alive</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    , living to her fullest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, it was such a spectacular sight to see Ange reaching her own
    answer, accepting it, and embracing it. It would not be a stretch to say
    that was the <strong>crystallization of all of Umineko’s essence</strong>.

  <p>
    The bottom line is, I understand why people perceive Ange as nothing more
    than an annoying existence.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, it all boils down to{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>“without love, it cannot be seen”</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    . I admit that my bias for Ange is substantial, but I digress.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, her character adds more depth to the already-intricate world
    of Umineko where the <strong>truth </strong>and <strong>magic</strong> are
    crucial elements of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Henceforth, having someone being{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>absolutely torn between them </em>
    </strong>
    is a refreshing addition to this universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    With all that being said, it still hurts like hell whenever I think about
    Ange. I mean, we have a girl who literally went through hell, only to be
    rewarded with a{" "}
    <em>“Hey there guess what, we all dead, how about joining us too?”</em>{" "}
    ending…
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though Ange is no longer my no.1 female character, she still holds a
    special place in my heart, not just because of the tragedy befalling upon
    her, but more so about who she is, a member of the Ushiromiya family, never
    look back, never regret.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rest well, my <strong>Witch of Resurrection</strong>.
