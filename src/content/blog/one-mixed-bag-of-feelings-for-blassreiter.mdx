    As I finished Blassreiter, there were quite some uneasiness that lingered
    and made me feel like rambling a lot . First thing I did was heading over
    the discussion forum, and wow tons of funny comments popped up and I
    couldn’t help but doing something about it. Even though it’d make me sound
    like an ass but it’s better than to left mistakes uncorrected.

  <blockquote>Amanda X Malek ship</blockquote>
  <p>
    What am I reading? Have you guys even seriously been watching the anime
    properly? This is nothing more than a creepy fantasizing of an “incestuous”
    relationship that should not be even mentioned, let alone exist in such an
    anime that doesn’t give 2 FUCK about romance and the likes.
  </p>
  <p>
    After how they trashed Grad, how they trashed Snow, how they trashed Herman,
    not even letting them a chance of telling their feelings to their love
    interest, and how Beatrice let Wolf bang her out of manipulating scheme, you
    should not expect any sort of possible intimate relationship to ever get
    their chance in Blassreiter, let alone this WiNcEsT abomination shit.
  </p>
  <blockquote>PrEtTy MuCh ThE oNlY gOoD tHiNg AbOuT tHiS sHoW: eLeA</blockquote>

    I had to take off my glasses and cleaned it to see if I got any of that
    wrong, but nope, some people actually said that. A boring, fanservice in the
    form of loli hologram A.I shit should not even be worth mentioning among the
    key elements of this anime tbh.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    The minister Victor cloned his own daughter for some creepy motive
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    There’s nothing wrong with how an old geezer just wants to see his loved one
    back. This theme had been exploited by many well known shows before like NGE
    (Gendou and Rei) and Card Captor Sakura (Tomoyo’s granpa and Sakura). It
    basically adds more depth to Victor, lame or not is debatable, but at the
    very least it denies the outcome of making Victor another generic mastermind
    with a shallow purpose that is typically shown in many anime.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Dead people all “came back” so yay it nullifies all their dramatic moments
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    SMH, people just seem to take everything at face value without even taking a
    few seconds considering the context behind it. Yes, they somewhat “came
    back”, but that’s just hologram/A.I shit, you cannot treat that as a living
    thing. It’s more of a consolation reward for what Amanda had to go through
    the entire show, but again, the reality is that THEY ARE ALL DEAD. Amanda
    deserves to be in a bit of fantasy with that AI shit but it can never
    replace the people who had already gone. That scene basically serves as a
    quick recap of major players in this anime, nothing more nothing less.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Xargin and Beatrice or basically the “bad guys” shouldn’t be at the ending
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    H A H A H A. After going through 24 episodes of building up such a big cast
    with many motives, if you guys still think this is another generic “bad vs
    good” show then aye it’s understandable that you have such shallow thought
    about the epilogue. Throughout the course of the anime, Amanda is more of an
    observer (main reason why they didn’t kill her off), she had many
    opportunities to witness many contradictory acts between the many opposing
    factions, and thus being able to analyze the situation and came up with a
    much more objective verdict of the scenario.
  </p>
  <p>
    She definitely felt anger about Wolf for backstabbing XAT. She definitely
    didn’t agree with Xargin’s goal. But she also definitely understood why
    things had to go that way, and therefore, she learned to forgive, so yeah
    though the epilogue sure gives off a bit of a corny atmosphere, I didn’t
    find it that much of a bother if I look at the anime as a whole picture.
  </p>
  <blockquote>Wolf shouldn’t be forgiven</blockquote>
  <p>
    This one is just a minor one but figured I should add something anyway. Wolf
    is just a victim of the grand scheme of all things. Yeah, he sure gave in to
    the power but that was still mostly thanks to Beatrice being so good of a
    trickster. Let’s not forget that Fred and Malek all fell for her “take the
    pill” shit. Not saying that Wolf is a good guy overall, but that’s just how
    life works in general. If things gone wrong even the noblest guy on Earth
    can turn into utter trash within seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alright, it might appear like I’ve been defending the show so much but
    that’s not really the case, I simply made some correction to some of the
    wrong takes by fellow watchers. The truth is, I’m really, really pissed at
    this anime for fucking ruined shit tons of potential to become something.
    Before I really go into the thought of the anime, I’d like to release some
    seemingly unsightly frustration first, you can skip the rant if you don’t
    feel like reading pointless stuff, I just simply wanna dump this somewhere.

    BOY, I AM MAD IRRITATED at the fact that they literally FUCKING TRASHED HER
    in the worst manner possible. FUCK THIS SHIT, she got the worst treatment of
    all the prominent cast in this anime. At least Lene (the girl died alongside
    Brad) got her flashback done right. But for Snow? WHAT THE FUCK? Just
    introduced her for barely 2 episodes then tossed her away like a piece of
    trash like that, boi they even did that off-screen L M A O, the creator sure
    got a bad sense of humor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like C’mon, they spent a fuck ton of moments on trash like Jill and her
    “real” boyfriend and couldn’t spare just one clean episode for Snow? Damn, I
    know this is probably the most pointless rant, but I just like Snow so much
    at the very first frame of her appearance, hoping that she could become some
    major player of the anime and then BAMMMM…
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess it’s just as someone pointed that the creator had more plans for the
    cast but for some reason failed to execute them all in a proper manner,
    hence they had to “compress” all of that into one big mess, which is really
    a damn shame. Snow isn’t the only victim but since she is a prime example
    and most horribly treated so I had to go an extra length in venturing my
    anger.
  </p>
  <p>
    Welp, guess that’s about it, just another section of me wasting time on
    trivial matters lmao.
