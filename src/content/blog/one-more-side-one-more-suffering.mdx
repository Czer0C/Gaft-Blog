    Oh boy, where do I begin? This novel, holy Jesus sweet mother of mercy.
    Alright I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. I have to say, when I first knew
    of its existence I was somewhat hyped (definitely not because of the cover)
    for many reasons, but the most simple and straightforward one is probably
    because of how much of a sucker I am for multi-narrative and BOI, it did not
    disappoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having too little information about Akari is probably the 2nd most regretful
    thing I have for the anime, and this “other side” did its job wonder
    covering that up. The writing is pretty solid in terms of expressing Akari’s
    mind as well as the thematic background surrounding her, which is cool.
    While I admit there’re some unexpected bumps out there but compared to the
    grand scheme of thing, they’re nothing, and it’s definitely fucking worth
    spending 6 hours on this trip to the “other side” of 5cm/s.
  </p>
  <p>
    The novel is also divided into 3 parts just like the main instance of the
    franchise, and god damn it sucked me in right off the bat with that sublime
    Akari’s narrative<s> (Ahem, I’m not fanboying her or anything alright?)</s>.
    I mean yeah most of this can be deduced from the anime, the same old “weak,
    timid and shy girl” trope never got old ain’t it, but what really sold here
    is how it cleverly cover itself with subtleties and some really cryptic
    foreshadowing of a
    <em>
      <em> potential sinister atmosphere</em>
    </em>{" "}
    underneath.
  </p>
  <p>
    No, I’m not talking about what happened in the anime – how the 2 characters
    ended up (it was sad, yeah, but not fucked up, alright maybe a bit), but
    something much more menacing behind Akari’s perspective and inner-thought in
    this 2nd novel. Basically the whole first chapter felt like a{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>fucking trap</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    At first glance it seems to be a rollercoaster ride of emotion. Akari went
    from a desperate young girl to being the happiest maiden in the world ever,
    and then BAMMM, shit happened and she got dragged down to the abyss again
    (ok that’s a bit of exaggeration but something like that). BUT THAT’S NOT
    ALL, there’s more to it than what it appears to offer because I’m damn sure
    this is no simple tale about love and sadness and shit like that.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was actually very heartwarming to see Akari going through various
    character transformations and transitions in the story. Seeing Akari{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>at the most “blossomy” period</em>
      </em>
    </strong>{" "}
    of her life really “did put a smile on my face”, and I laughed a lot with
    her naive, cutesy, and even bold interactions with Takaki (gosh these 2 are
    meant for each other <s>fuck you Shinkai</s>). To top it off I think the
    writer did a really great job of portraying Akari’s desire and craving in
    this stage because not only does it feel real but also fitting to her
    “image” in the anime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shit, I would be lying to say I didn’t want any part of it, like, being able
    to casually spend time aimlessly doing whatever the fuck I want, giving no
    fuck to anything or anyone else, or just simply sit/lie down and think of
    pointless stuff, gosh, I’d pay to get a day like that (since when have I
    started going old geezer mode, ah youth).
  </p>
  <p>
    And YES, finally the true meaning behind the title (5cm/s) is revealed. Lots
    of people theorized that it’s the pace at which people walk past one another
    in life. While I don’t think that’s a bad way to put it but it just doesn’t
    add up with the setting when the phrase was first ushered in the anime, and
    heck what were we even thinking, the answer was right in front of our eyes,
    just a fucking simple love confession, yet so powerful and filled with{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>hope </em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    (<em>
      <em>crying now</em>
    </em>) in it. As the story moved on, that phrase carried much more weight than
    it originally was supposed to, which is really something.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, those sparkling moments wouldn’t last forever. A calm before the
    storm they say, can’t be more accurate. The first 1/3 of Akari’s narrative
    was pretty sad enough (she even thought of killing herself, like wut?), but
    damn the last and concluding segment was literally a tsunami of feels. It’s
    not just about how desperate Akari was but more of her inner unintentional “
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>destructive</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    ” side.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve always found the anime’s introductory sequence a little off despite the
    cheerful tone it gives, like cmon what’s so bad about 2 kids running down a
    hill and got separated for a bit by the train? Well yeah, it seems normal
    but if I look carefully again, Akari went ahead of Takaki without looking
    back, at her own pace, and casually too.
  </p>
  <p>
    That was always the part that bugged me the most, and “One more side” pretty
    much solidified this idea with Akari’s thought during that moment. The
    famous Cherry Blossom tree scene also got more polishing in many ways, and
    it basically put the final nail in the coffin with Akari’s remark on their
    separation being{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>unavoidable </em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    regardless of the circumstance they are put in. It was a legit “holy fuck” moment
    to me, though kind of ruined the sacred and out-of-this-world atmosphere after
    that intimate moment, but fuck, it really hit where it hurt the most.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know I might be reading too much into this but I think that’s how 5cm/s
    was meant to be, as Shinkai once stated, which is for us audience to come up
    with our own answer. It’s an immovable truth that Akari’s feeling toward
    Takaki is beyond that of love, BUT, that exact moment when they shared their
    first kiss was the{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>peak </em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    of their relationship… or their
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>“story“</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    . They knew that they could not, or
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>must not</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    , take any further step beyond that.
  </p>
  <p>
    It seems unreasonable and full of bullshitery if I have to be honest, but at
    the same time, so beautiful, so “shining”. I remember that Gilgamesh in
    Fate/Stay Night made a pretty cool quote about “true beauty are things that
    are unreachable”, and it kinda fits 5cm/s neatly. Their relationship had
    basically ascended perfection, WHICH IS WHY THEY MUST SAVOR IT, it must
    remain pure and unsullied. But how? The answer is easily the rest of the
    story with each of their own journey toward their maturity.
  </p>
  <p>
    While part 2 and part 3 might have not delivered a powerful impact as part 1
    (which is ironically the same as the first novel or anime), I could not stop
    turning into the new page as I kept reading. The main problem I have with
    part 2 is that it feels a bit “fanservice-ish”, just for the sake of
    comforting Sumida ship. For the record I don’t hold any bias against Sumida,
    she’s a good girl with a cool personality, but the anime kinda nails into my
    mind the idea that Takaki could not <strong>see</strong> anyone but Akari
    during his time in the secluded island, so it makes me question the
    canonicity of “One more side” (written by a different person anyway lel).
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, if I separate the anime from this it’s not too bad of the ride
    to enjoy, especially how it digs deeper into Takaki’s darkest corner and
    reveals some quite disturbing truth (he’s quite similar to Akari in this
    regard). I think the general idea is that Takaki wants to “try” loving
    Sumida but the past just keeps tying him down so it’ll only cause pain, and
    he doesn’t want Sumida to suffer for that (exactly what happens in the last
    chapter), so it’s quite interesting to see a completely different picture of
    this segment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last chapter is truly a blast. I was legit bombarded with lots of
    unexpected “GOD WHY” moments. I mean it’s quite obvious that Akari still has
    the “past” lingering but fuck, it was just too hard to swallow how subtle
    her reaction, emotion and thought whenever it was brought up, simply feels
    like a knife slowly cutting through my old wound (leftover from the anime).
    Every time the “dream” was brought up, I got an ache. Every time Akari
    wondered about “something” that related to “that”, I got an ache. Every time
    Akari gave off a sense of “regret” about the past, I got an ache.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fuck, it’s literally a train of piercing emotion, something that I rarely
    got even among my most favorite works. The highlight of Akari’s narrative to
    me is definitely when she said “
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>Perhaps I’ve taken something away from him</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    “. I don’t know why, it might sound pretentious but to me, it’s just too delicate,
    too elegant, something that seems to have been evoked from Akari’s most concealed
    quarter of sense and mind. It’s not like this is the first time I’ve seen something
    like this, Umineko, Tsukihime, Angel Beats, heck though not literally, they are
    all about “sharing” a bond so deep that words can’t describe, so yeah, this one
    just simply hits home.
  </p>
  <p>
    And holy shit, from the anime (and first novel) I know Takaki was pretty
    much in a fucked up state during the final phase of the story but this just
    goes double as it’s revealed in depth. I legit feel bad for the 3rd girl,
    Mizuno (or 4th? or maybe whatever don’t even know how many girls this guy
    dated lmao).
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what would have happened to Sumida should Takaki decided to give it
    a go (quite menacing when I think about it), kinda gives off a “love and
    destruction” vibe hmmm. That being said, as gloomy as the ride has mostly
    been, the final moment, just like the anime, sparked a light ray of hope
    onto Takaki, thus making a fitting conclusion to the journey he has been
    through, and the decision he finally chose to make.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, both Akari and Takaki still hold their{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>“actual other half”</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    *somewhere in the deepest closest to their mind. Whatever year span they came
    up with is merely an excuse to avoid it, but damn sure they still have some sort
    of special affection toward each other. It’s just that the path they chose is
    completely different, one has a*
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>“goal”</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    and decided to exhaustively chase it, while the other simply wander aimlessly
    in search of something to cover up
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>“that”</em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    (or just move on to make it simple).
  </p>
  <p>
    What really got me is the minor expansion on the conclusion of the story, as
    it constantly bounced between Akari and Takaki’s perspective to paint the
    full picture of the “tragedy” to come. And fuck what better way there is to
    put an end to the tale with the 2 forsaken letters from the very first stage
    of the story (made me think that they sure have come a really really long
    way).
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s been a very long time since I last had this strong surge of goosebump
    almost to the point of tearing up. I mean there’s nothing special about
    those letters, I could only see 2 youngsters sharing their deepest and
    innermost corner of their heart, but why is it so magnificent yet tragic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long story short, while Akari and Takaki have had their destiny made clear
    in the anime, “one more side” successfully fleshed out the characters as
    well as providing a slightly different approach to the conclusion of their
    tale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like the original instance, I think this one also peaked in chapter 1.
    Not gonna lie, even though there were lots of extra scenes that weren’t (or
    I wish they were) on the anime, I could picture all of them in most crystal
    clear view ever, ahhhhh, youth (again)… It is sad, it is full of regret, but
    it is also majestic and cathartic at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <em>
        Farewell Akari, the path you have chosen is definitely the most correct
        one, some people might blame or hate you for that but it is just simply
        inexorable, may fortune be with you and a bright future awaits…
