  <p>
    Being self-aware is often a sign that an anime is knowing what it's doing,
    but sometimes it might come up as being try-hard instead, and sadly that
    falls into the case for Re:Creators. That said, this was partly my fault for
    having too much expectation for it (never learn, do I).
  </p>
  <p>
    Before diving into the rant part, I'd still gonna point out some positive
    things I have for this series because at least I had some fun watching it.

    The best thing about this anime is no doubt the aesthetics aspect which
    could be summed up in one word: clean. It would be a lie to say I didn't
    come here for Altair via some random video I found on the Internet 😂. But
    for real man, her design is just so good, basically ticked most of the boxes
    that I tend to pay attention to. Of course, the rest of the cast also
    received similar treatment I'd add, for if they don't possess fancy outfits
    as Altair did, the fighting animation for most of the characters never
    failed to deliver the hype (Sirius should come close as 2nd after Altair).

    As mentioned above, this producer of this anime was pretty confident in what
    they were trying to achieve, hence the constant 4th-wall breaking. Though
    this has some drawbacks such as being repetitive or even downright annoying,
    I did find some of them pretty engaging to go along, especially the recap
    episode that actually has some legit purposes rather than stalling time for
    more ideas and such.

    What an evil look. This armor, so many lines. The puffy skirt just gets in
    the way during action scenes. And this weird rectangular part around the
    waist. Her hair is too long, it's a pain to animate it. Especially when
    viewed from the back. She just looks like a light-blue ball of fur.{" "}
    <strong>Just like a mutated mop.</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    If I may speak on behalf of the animation staff, this character was designed
    just to make their jobs difficult. It makes us question the sanity of the designer.

    Lastly, the sound element of Re:Creators is not one to be scoffed at. While
    the two epic OPs should be more than enough to get me excited, the BGM are
    so well catered to keep pace with the intensity of the story. Lastly, the
    seiyuu have also been carefully selected to blend in flawlessly with the
    characters they're responsible for, which is very nice.

    To wrap up this section, it would not be a stretch to say the production

    Admittedly, this anime actually did a pretty good job at the first half by
    presenting an intriguing world-building filled with meticulously crafted
    characters and lore and stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean the reverse-isekai is one thing but adding a lot of dialogs to
    further enhance the exposition and solidifying its structure is something
    you rarely get to see in any kind of fantasy-ish story nowadays.

    Unfortunately, things suddenly took a more negative turn as they tried to
    one-up themselves by bloating out the contents for no particular reason.
  </p>
  <h2 id="what-was-lacking">What Was Lacking</h2>
  <p>
    I'll be frank, initially, this anime gave off the impression of a knock-off
    version of Fate (mixing a bit of Dies Irae I'd argue but whatever), yet even
    so, the direction was neat as they tried to explore from one side to
    another. But everything has a limit, at least in Fate we get a clear fixed
    number from the start, but here in Re:Creators they probably had no idea
    what to do with the remaining space of the show so instead of polishing the
    already-sufficient cast (at least focus on the creator/creation chemistry
    bruh) they just went out of their way and add more random stuff that
    literally nobody was asking for and thus making things messy and incohesive
    (And I honestly don't give two shit about Megane or whatever 😴).
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps they felt the need to even the odds for both sides, seeing as how
    Altair's allies kept dwindling by the episode, but that was all for naught
    in all honesty given how ridiculously OP she is rofl. Not to mention how
    awfully convenient it was that &nbsp;almost everyone just turned against her
    after talk-no-jutsu, I definitely prefer them not siding her in the first
    place.

      Removing the 4 in the background and team Altair would still easily be at

    Simply put, one of the main complaints I have for this series is the
    overflowed pool of characters especially those that came out later as the
    story approached its finish line, meanwhile, the main cast which had a solid
    foundation failed to receive the care they truly need. With the exception of
    Meteora, all of them were basically underdeveloped at the end of the show,
    some even got sidetracked badly to make way for the cringey secondary cast
    that came out later, which is quite a shame.

    Apart from that, the deal with Altair, the center point of the whole story,
    felt rather half-assedly done. I mean don't get me wrong I definitely
    enjoyed her end-game moment with her 'creator' but the path to get there was
    rather rough to say the very least. Her motive and action at the beginning
    really piqued my interest and I genuinely came to this anime mostly because
    of her, but to my disappointment, her character kinda was limited by her own
    plot, which is also a shame given how much potential she had with the
    endless supply of "materials".

      With this kind of "aura" I expected something more grandiose to her story
      than petty revenge 🤷‍♂️
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    To elaborate, I feel like Altair's action and motives weren't justified
    enough given the scale of the story that kept growing exponentially towards
    the end. Yeah sure, what happened to her 'creator' was definitely depressing
    but I'm not sure if that alone was enough to make her go to great lengths of
    breaking the 4th wall and committing universal genocide or such which when
    looking back might just seem funny. But to me, this isn't the biggest issue,
    for that should lie with the mistreatment she got for similar reasons stated
    in the previous section.

    Instead of cramming everything into the endgame, they should have at least
    dedicated one episode somewhere in the middle explaining Altair's past FROM
    HER POV, not through by someone else's or even worse, their mere speculation
    which is lame.
  </p>
  <p>
    Point is, they should have disclosed the thought process behind this
    whimsical character before she arrived at her ultimate decision of wiping
    out the universe and such. But nah, instead, all we got was some vague
    threatening foreshadowing and just Altair chilling in a chair at a variety
    of occasions.

      Her being the "bad guy" wouldn't make a fine excuse to deny her a proper
      POV either given how obvious it was near the end of the show that they
      were all dead set on making her the <strong>actual </strong>main character
      or <em>the origin of all things</em> lol.

    But yes - at the risk of repeating myself - despite the transgression, her
    heart-to-heart moment with the creator was really well done as it showcased
    the truest and innermost side of Altair's character, so probably the one of
    the two redeeming point for the entirety of the 2nd-half (the other one is
    Sirius combat scene boi that shit was literal 🔥).

    All and all, much to some of my discontent for this anime, I still think it
    deserves some recognition for the efforts made to create something different
    than the norm. In a time where anime lists mostly consist of bland, lazy
    adaptations, original works like Re:Creators will always be there to attempt
    a revolution, whether the odds are against them or not, and that's why I
    can't see myself losing hope on this medium just yet.
