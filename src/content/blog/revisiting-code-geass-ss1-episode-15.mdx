  <p>
    I think the reason C.C formed a contract with Mao is quite simple, just like
    LL who almost faced death at episode 1, C.C probably met Mao in a similar
    scenario, Mao got into some shit and was about to die, C.C hopped in and
    said “Hi, wanna make it out alive? Looking for super duper cool power? Looks
    no further, say one word and I’ll make a contract with you and we’ll get
    shit done in no time, also don’t forget that you’ll be my slave from now on
    for no particular reason XD”.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway jk aside, this episode was quite something, I like the chemistry
    between C.C and LL so much, though C.C appears to be selfish and acts like
    she doesn’t give a shit about everyone around her, deep inside she really
    does care! She couldn’t kill Mao because of their bond in the past. She
    couldn’t jeopardy LL’s “career” due to their adventure since this series
    began. So yeah it’s quite a fucked up scenario for C.C and she was torn
    between the past (Mao) and the present (LL) and therefore couldn’t make the
    right decision. Though C.C has yet to reveal her term of the contract, I
    figure it should be something of significance to her, probably extremely
    sensitive as well which is why she doesn’t feel like telling it to LL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Come to think of it, maybe her condition has something to do with parting
    way with the accomplice, I mean think about it, since Mao loved C.C that
    much, C.C realized that revealing her term would only end up hurting him
    more, so she decided to leave him. It’s quite savage to treat people as
    tools like that but at least C.C take their feeling into consideration as
    well. C.C places her goal above anything else but she doesn’t forget to come
    up with the most optimized solution for her partners.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for Shirley’s memories concern, I don’t know about you guys but back in
    highschool me and meh friends usually play the “ignore someone” or “playing
    along with everyone” games so it’s not something that strange for the
    student council to have no problem with LL and Shirley’s relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding the battle of wits, a bit convenient but well given the context of
    this anime I can’t say it’s not satisfying, I like how Mao got rekt due to
    his arrogance and blinded love for C.C. His past is pretty much of a
    tragedy, it cannot be reversed (sort of like a wound turns necrotizing
    fasciitis) so yeah LL had a point about ending his life instead of letting
    roam free which would eventually cause unnecessary damage to C.C’s future.
    On top of that, we get to know that LL is a hardcore tsundere as well, all
    that act cool and cold on the outside won’t be of any help in hiding his
    true feeling for C.C XD.
