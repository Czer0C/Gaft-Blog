    The scene with C.C looking at the big pizza was priceless.
    <s> C.C and pizza, a better love story than Twightlight.</s>

    And lol look at how carefree she and Lelouch were at this almost-busted
    moment, nothing can top this duo at all!

    Also find the conversation between Euphie and Nunnally to be both hilarious
    and well quite dramatic at the same time. It appears that Euphie and LL had
    quite a past when the Empire wasn’t this fucked up. My guess is that LL once
    treated Euphie as something more than just a{" "}
    <em>
      <em>sister</em>
    </em>
    , hence he didn’t have a to raise his guard on her in the Island episode. The
    same went for Euphie but she found a new love interest now, so a no-go then,
    phew, almost stepped on a danger zone eh LL and Euphie.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, the school fest was fun, but Euphi’s proposal sure is the highlight
    of this episode. Yeah, she’s naive, narrow-minded but her intention is
    completely out of malice or any ulterior motive behind it.. Therefore,
    people should think twice before saying things like she’s dumb or annoying
    or a nuisance to Zero’s plan just because their beloved LL is put in a
    disadvantage.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point of the anime, I find Schnizel to be quite deplorable, it was
    hinted in his introduction that he doesn’t bother to give 2 shit about
    anyone around him, he just put on a facade to win people’s affection and in
    turn, exploit them till there’s nothing left valuable. Euphie is facing the
    same predicament, we all know that there ain’t no way Schnizel would approve
    of the Eleven due to the royal blood thingy, but the fact that he concurred
    with Euphie’s plan that super fast must give hints of something very bad is
    going to happen in the next few episodes. Just as how LL realized how
    Euphie’ plan fucked him up, Schnizel should also share a similar viewpoint,
    hence his approval of Euphie’s proposal, but sadly, the mind of a naive and
    innocent princess can never allow her to have even 1 tiny doubt about her
    brother, well-played writer.

    On a side note, I don’t really hate any character in this anime, quite in
    fact, I’ve found the cast to be well-invested to a degree, there sure are
    lots of flaws but I’d dare say the producers did their best to cater the fan
    in many ways, not just for money. I’m quite disappointed at the fanbase of
    this anime who only care about how great LL is without considering how the
    supporting casts are struggling to be something else.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>TLDR</strong>: don’t just keep your eyes on LL, give other
    characters a chance as well.
