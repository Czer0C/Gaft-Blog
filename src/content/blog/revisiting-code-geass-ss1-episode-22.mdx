    Man I’m totally speechless by now, the final shot really nailed it with LL’s
    tear:

    Talk about karma, shit, Sunrise sure loves bringing things from the past
    under the disguise as debt collector (like what they did to Cowboy Bebop),
    brilliant. Although I must admit the fact that LL let his mouth got the best
    of him is like the biggest plot convenience ever, given the context that
    Geass has been building up over more than half of this season, it cannot be
    considered as an asspull. C.C warned him many times before, he is aware of
    it, but sometimes in life even when you’re prepared to the teeth shit can
    still happen at the most critical situation, LL just simply experienced the
    worst kind of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Euphie is just another collateral damage in the path of LL, he must accept
    it, but I think the cost is too huge so it shouldn’t be easy for him to get
    over it. It’s quite ironic that up until this point, all those LL{" "}
    <strong>deliberately</strong> used the Geass on to force them doing
    something they didn’t want actually had their honor{" "}
    <strong>salvaged</strong> while Euphie, whom LL accidentally triggered the
    power, got her reputation stained as dark and deep as mud. Take a look at
    the incompetent Japanese Liberation generals back in the earlier episodes,
    they only thought about running or using underhanded tactics, but LL came
    and forced them to commit suicide, tadaaa, the Jap loves it because it
    follows the Samurai’s tradition. However, Euphie here who has a genuine
    intention of making Brit and Eleven a better place and was only rewarded
    with only contempt and hatred.

    Other than that dramatic outcome of this episode, I enjoyed the political
    affairs in this one, looks like Schnizel doesn’t appear to have any
    malicious intention (given his genuine reaction) behind Euphie’s plan like I
    stated in the previous episode, but well he’s still using her so he can get
    back to his job so it’s not like he didn’t exploit any bit of her XD.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looks like things will get really ugly from now, Geass might have had quite
    some bumps over past 21 episodes but 22 is probably the best viewing
    experience for this anime to me.
