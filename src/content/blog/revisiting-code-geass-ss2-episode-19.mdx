  <p>
    Lots of shit happened but well it‚Äôs as expected from CG, I must say though
    there‚Äôre lotta problems regarding plot consistencies and character writing,
    the drama was handled pretty neatly.
  </p>
  <p>
    First off is the Rolo redemption or whatever you wanna call it, much to my
    despise towards him, to be fair, he got a really shitty childhood with no
    proper caring and lack of effective education so his acts of killing Shirley
    and Nunnally can be somewhat justified due to his inability to comprehend{" "}
    <em>
      <em>right/wrong</em>
    </em>{" "}
    as well as extreme jealousy (the yaoi undertone still leaves a bad taste to
    me). He‚Äôs still shit but yeah LL is a so much of a god that drives people
    insane so I think it‚Äôs quite understandable why he did that, still can‚Äôt
    forgive him though. His deed in this episode can be considered as a parting
    gift to LL, it‚Äôs sort of a fucked up scenario that I don‚Äôt even know whether
    to cheer or remain resentful toward him, so well I guess it‚Äôs a tie. Anyway,
    this is probably the biggest defeat of LL so far, in both physical and
    mental state, no more army, <s>no more harem</s> no more supporters, no more
    those he holds dear, the only thing left is his goal to end the root of all
    this, Charles.

    Another interesting subtlety in this episode is the ‚Äúfarewell‚Äù between
    Kallen and Zero. Kallen sure proved that she without a doubt deserves the
    title ‚Äúleft-hand‚Äù man of LL (C.C is right-hand since she gave LL power and
    handled lots of shits). I mean back at episode 2 of SS2, Kallen was dead
    serious about willing to be a slave to LL, it‚Äôs out of the question that she
    would dedicate everything to LL even when everybody turns their back on LL.

    Just by looking at her eyes and expression at the climax of this episode is
    enough to tell me that Kallen was willing to go all out and beat the shit
    out of the peeps who ‚Äúbetrayed‚Äù LL, and LL knew this, but since he really
    cares about Kallen (call it favoritism or whatever but it‚Äôs inevitable given
    the way things laid out between them) and cannot afford to lose another
    important friend of his, he had to ‚Äúchase‚Äù her away with harsh words, which
    is the last thing you wanna do when saying goodbye to someone. I know it‚Äôs
    cliche but very well done IMO. Kallen is without a doubt one of the stars of
    this season now along with LL and CC. It‚Äôs quite unfortunate that if only LL
    had opened up himself to everyone, not just to CC or Kallen, then things
    might have not turned out this badly.
