  <p>
    Too many plot convenience and inconsistencies, it feels like the 2nd half of
    this season were written in a very rushed manner, the writers disregard lots
    of detail as well as the nature of characters established in SS1. However,
    entertainment-wise, it’s not something I can get every day or month, even
    year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time to dig a little bit deeper into the characters, while some people may
    find Nunnally to be annoying/dumb let’s not forget that she’s very young and
    lacks the capability to comprehend all those complicated shit like politics,
    not to mention that it was also thanks to Schnizel’s sweet words that
    Nunnally got influenced and decided to stand up against her brother.
    Schnizel is a dick for manipulating people with that carefree/cheerful face
    of his, he’s no different from Charles, pretending to be good to people but
    in actuality, he just wanna exploit then toss them away like trash, I’m glad
    he got rekt by LL despite the stupid plot convenience.

    Apart from that, Nunnally just wanna share her burden with LL, since she
    understands LL has been through a lot for her and she felt guilty about it
    and just wanna do something to make amend. When you look at it as a bigger
    picture, it’s a splendid sight of 2 siblings “competing” against each other
    to see who score the bigger one (hatred) just so the other won’t get hurt,
    fight to heal (kinda like, “You’ve done enough bro, hold my beer and lemme
    show ya I’m not worthless”). Anyway, LL’s plan is probably on a way way
    bigger scale than that of Nunnally, so I think he wouldn’t stop at just mere
    words from Nunnally. That said, her resolve to break the Geass sure is
    something, the only person who’ve ever succeeded in that regard is Euphie.

    On a different note, it would appear that C.C and LL have officially
    accepted each other at long last. Now that they have nothing to hide, it
    wouldn’t be too far-fetched to say CC is the only person who can stay by LL
    since she understands his power the most and can’t be affected by it. The
    fact that LL was worried about CC simply nailed the relationship between
    them, he doesn’t treat her as a useful “hand” for his scheme anymore, nor
    did CC think of LL as a tool for accomplishing her goal, they were there at
    the battlefield on their own will, which is quite poetic given the fact that
    they could remain that calm and had time for such casual chatting in a very
    dying situation.

    C.C’s fight with Kallen was relatively short, but it’s interesting to know
    that she actually cared about winning/losing, which implies that her icy
    armor has been shattered all thanks to LL. It might also be a hint of
    jealousy since Kallen was also LL’s favorite, CC felt like she was pushed
    aside back when the 3 were still at the OBK, so the duel at this episode
    gave off a “settlement between LL’s ladies” vibe to me lmao.
