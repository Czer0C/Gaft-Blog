        <strong>Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight</strong>
      </em>
    </em>{" "}
    is one of those rare pieces of fiction that the more I revisit the better it
    gets. And holy shit, when I think about it I’m really glad that I got to
    know it, albeit via a pretty awkward scenario but that’s a story for another
    time.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, there’s still one big puzzle that has yet to be solved,
    which is also a pretty important element of the show itself, namely the
    Revue.

    <h2>
      <b>Premise</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Let’s first take a look at the premise of the underground auditions, as
    provided by the Giraffe aka the showrunner:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <em>Song and dance woven into a mesmerizing play.</em>
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>
      To whoever puts on the brightest-shining revue, the path to becoming the
      top star will open up.
    </em>
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>
      The more they can feel the glimmer that the stage girls emmit, the more
      the lighting, the audio system, and the stage mechanisms will begin to
      dance on their own.
    </em>
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>
      Acting, song, and dance… This stage will respond to the glimmer of the
      stage girls.
    </em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Given all the information above, it appears that the Revue isn’t just a
    showcase of skill and raw talent, but something much more impactful and
    meaningful.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>The Revues</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Take <strong>Revue of Pride</strong> for example. It started off normally
    but when Karen became arrogant with her naivety, Maya went all out with the
    song and dance and thus shaped the stage to her own will, which obliterated
    Karen.
  </p>

      className="kg-image"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Another great example is the<strong> Revue of Solitude</strong> where Hikari
    literally threw a fucking Tokyo tower into the middle of the fight, not to
    mention a gigantic wave of tsunami to further overwhelm Nana.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

      height={338}
      width={600}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    There’s also the <strong>Revue of Jealousy</strong> that features Mahiru,
    though it might come up as meme material but seriously speaking, it does
    give some food for thought about the system behind the auditions. Like how
    was Mahiru able to interfere with the other stages that were running in the
    underground theater during that time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spooky isn’t it? Because from the first 2 cases above it was simply object
    manipulation, but here it’s something more whimsical, kinda like breaking
    the boundary of common sense.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>How it Works</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    All are desperate. Normal happiness, the joys of girls… All will be burned
    to aim for a distant glimmer. That’s what it means to be a stage girl.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    So basically, a Revue doesn’t necessarily reflect a girl’s capability in
    their ordinary world, as it can be manipulated through sheer will or desire.
    The stronger it burns inside the girls, the more{" "}
    <strong>advantageous the revues</strong> become to them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      With this, it all adds up to me how Nana was able to seemingly one-sided
      her battle against Maya.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Nana was interested in backstage work so she got deep knowledge of how it’s
    run, thus giving her even more advantage against Maya in the field that
    doesn’t solely rely on raw talent.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, her hidden potential as a stage girl and the desire to
    <strong> carry the burden all of her classmates</strong> (30 of them!!) just
    simply made her too stacked against Maya and thus resulted in an overwhelming
    victory.

  <p>
    That’s not to say that Nana falls short behind Maya in terms of talent. I
    just find it hard to believe that Nana made the fight look one-sided, part
    of this is because they didn’t show the full audition or the full picture
    behind it (really though, we only had like 10s before they showed the
    aftermath of the actual first audition lol).
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing to take into account is how Hikari and Karen were able to
    defeat Nana despite their previous failure against other girls.{" "}
    <em>Hikari was overwhelmed by Junna</em> on the{" "}
    <strong>Revue of Passion</strong>, while Karen was defeated by Maya. So does
    this really say anything about their victory against Nana?
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, again, this backs up the idea of stage play being greatly influenced by
    a girl’s desire.

      Maya <strong>has always and will always</strong> be at the peak of her own

      Nana, on the other hand, can only be at the top condition <strong>
        when she pursues her ideal world of an everlasting 99th stage play

    <h2>
      <b>Bottom Line</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Long story short, Maya and Nana are on the same tier when it comes to Revue
    prowess, one is stable while the other requires{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        <em>overclocking </em>
      </em>
    </strong>
    to be OP. However, there are still lots of questions that remained unsolved to
    me.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Like, <em>were Nana and Maya the first 2 stage girls</em>? What happened
      to the others?
    </li>
    <li>
      If they really were part of the very first Revue then did they just simply
      decide to offscreen every other audition?
    </li>
    <li>
      But then that begs the question,{" "}
      <strong>what does it really take to obtain the Star Tiara?</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Because on the main timeline Maya had been no.1 for quite some time,
      defeating many of her peers, but she just somehow{" "}
      <strong>never got qualified</strong> while Nana only needed one victory to
      take it all?
    </li>
    <li>
      Or maybe Maya won as well but she{" "}
      <em>didn’t give a shit about what the Giraffe was offering</em> so she
      just went along and kept the stage on to challenge others and continue to
      evolve?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The more I think about it the more questions arise and frankly while it’s a
    bit frustrating to not get the full answer of all things, it only makes me
    appreciate this anime more.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are literally <strong>infinite potentials</strong> for Revue Starlight
    to expand its universe even further but sadly due to the limited duration it
    had to make do with this pretty tightly put plot to reach the conclusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    With all said and done, while everything about stage play or audition is not
    crystal clear yet, especially the <strong>Revue of Astral Sins</strong>, the
    anime did a solid job at polishing the symbolism and the characters so I
    guess I can’t complain much because it is those factors that define this
    anime.
