    As the Revue franchise continues to march its way into a new horizon, I find
    myself being ensnared by excitement... and a bit of pondering.

    I mean, execution-wise the movie did more than enough to cater to my
    expectation. The revues are splendidly done with countless whimsical effects
    and beautiful soundtracks to bolster the atmosphere of the ever-glamourous
    "competitions" between the girls.

    To top it off, the design has also significantly glowed up. I mean, apart
    from polishing the main stage instrumental elements I had a very fun time
    with the chilling moments of the stage girls in their casual modes, would
    not be a stretch to say the producers were very meticulous in every corner
    of the movie.

  <p>
    Yet again, as the expansion movie pressed on, I could not help but raise a
    few questions along the way. Yes, I understand the true intention behind
    this seemingly long-winded followed-up installment of the Revue franchise.

    Both from the audience AND the revue stage girls' perspective,
    <em> it's just kinda difficult to move on</em>
    <strong>.</strong> There'll always be<em> something that lingers</em> in our
    mind that would potentially <strong>trigger a memory callback</strong>, or
    worse, re-ignite the pain, passion, and desire that once resided within
    ourselves.

  <p>
    For the record, while the TV series has managed to bring about a fitting
    closure to the story of the 9 characters, I personally have no qualm with
    how they chose to revoke the curtain on the stage for a brand new
    expedition, or to be more accurate, settle some{" "}
    <strong>unfinished business.</strong>

    But yeah, as I said, <em>something just feels off</em> about this.
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess sometimes you just can't force things to move forward despite the
    incentive it might yield in the process of doing so. Truthfully, I myself as
    a fan of Revue Starlight <em>really want to see more of the series</em>, but
    if you have no solid clue of what to do next, better l
    <strong>eaving it as it is than heading toward an unclear direction</strong>.

  <p>
    All said and one, I would not go as far as saying that this movie didn't
    deliver, but it felt like they were <em>biting off more than they chew</em>.
    Of course, this<em> </em>
    <strong>has nothing to do with "milking"</strong>. For once, the fact that they
    were <em>trying their hardest</em> to cram so much content into this tight space
    of 2 hours is a testament to their goodwill and valiant effort. Unfortunately,
    however, that didn't work out well for the most part. So yeah, I'd dare label
    the Revue movie as <em>"quality fanservice"</em>. It has some not-so-minor problems,
    but the end result is that I had fun watching it, so who cares.

          Too much focus on Karen and Hikari. I mean yeah they're the
          protagonists but this is still quite ridiculous given how half of the
          "new content" is literally just{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>repeating the same thing</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          that was already elaborated in the TV series.
        </li>
        <li>
          This remains <strong>unclear </strong>to me but from the look of it,
          the "group fight" on the train was likely a means to{" "}
          <em>solidify Nana's position</em> among the girls, which is honestly
          not a very effective move because it only{" "}
          <strong>severe the integrity of SS1</strong> where everybody was
          having <strong>equal </strong>chances. Or maybe I'm reading too much
          into this and Nana was just really "drunk" lmao. That said the fight
          was still pretty hype on an entertainment level. A fun small detail
          here is the fact that while Nana is a minor "on paper" mentally{" "}
          <em>she should be reaching the age of a grumpy old lady</em> by now
          but whatever 😂
        </li>
        <li>
          Maya and Claudine's conflict was pretty cool aesthetics-wise,
          featuring up to 4 acts! While the character interaction felt a little
          awkward (<em>got nothing to do with the homo stuff I swear</em>), the
          revue was fiery regardless. Still, I'm not sure how to feel about the
          original OST <strong>Hokori to Ogori</strong> being partially
          "recycled" as part of this new revue between this enigmatic duo.
        </li>
        <li>
          The revue of Junna and Nana probably snatched the highest spotlight in
          this movie to me. Again, though I understand Nana's feelings towards
          Junna and the girls, nobody was asking her to do any of this. To
          clarify, I don't mean to make any harsh criticism about Nana's
          character of course, for her passion, desire, and resolve are
          something I can really appreciate in this mildly negatively portrayed
          setting of the Revue Starlight franchise. All said and done, Junna's
          performance was particularly outstanding that kept on making me cheer
          for her "you got this" 😳
        </li>
        <li>
          Mahiru vs Hikari is pretty intriguing despite the kinda uncalled-for
          jumpscare, I like the OST used here anyhow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some bait with bloodbath but whatever (probably the biggest
          disappointment about this movie
          <em>
            <strong>
              {" "}
              all thanks to the ending of the recap movie which raised the bar so
              high.😅)
            </strong>
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Futaba vs Kaoruko was also pretty nice thematically. I enjoyed the
          style and direction used in this one as it kinda blended in pretty
          well with the characters' nature without sacrificing the flow of the
          story.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>"We are already on the stage" </strong>is a nice central theme
          for the whole movie which indicates the endless struggle that would
          follow the girls no matter where they are, also adds up to how the
          Revues <em>no longer being held underground</em> but expanded further
          beyond that to the border of reality and dream or some sort which is
          cool and might be mindblowing, I think.
