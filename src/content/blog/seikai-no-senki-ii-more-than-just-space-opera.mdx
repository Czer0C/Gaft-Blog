      <b>[MINOR SPOILERS]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    Seikai no Senki II unravels yet another story act of Jinto and Lafiel as
    they continue the voyage into space and <strong>planar </strong>space (yep,
    they have two different types of space here woohoo).
  </p>
  <p>
    Admittedly, the plot this time can be a bit <strong>predictable</strong>,
    especially with the pretty awkward spoiler-ish prologue in the first
    episode. Nonetheless, just as I thought my enjoyment was soiled from the
    get-go, SnS II threw me in a <strong>rollercoaster </strong>ride of emotion
    while <em>barely reaching the halfway point</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time the end credit rolled, I had already found myself being
    overwhelmed by a rather indescribable sense of catharsis.
  </p>

    <h2>
      <b>Story &amp; World-Building</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Though Jinto and Lafiel are undoubtedly the focal points of the series, the
    anime <em>doesn't solely rely on them</em> to keep the ride engaging.
  </p>
  <p>
    Far surpassing my anticipation, the creator managed to further expand
    world-building compared to the previous installments with intricate{" "}
    <strong>politics</strong> and enthralling <strong>lore</strong>, which can
    get very hyped IMO.

    The best part is that, despite all those interludes, the relationship
    between Lafiel and Jinto could{" "}
    <em>still progress and develop so seamlessly</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not even exaggerating. For a <strong>10-episode </strong>work, they
    really outdid themselves with so much quality content.
  </p>
  <p>
    The anime can indeed get a bit long-winded at some points, but those moments
    are like short breaks from tension, and as soon as I got bored,{" "}
    <em>they threw me back in the rabbit hole</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although politics is a recurring subject in SnS II, accompanying it is
    eloquent dialogues with well pacing and good directing that concentrate on
    characters' outward{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>"appearance"</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    to emphasize their hidden motives as well as subtle foreshadowing. Thanks to
    that, it is no more than a mundane task getting the grip of the situation
    and how the world of Seikai operates in general.
  </p>

  <p>
    What's more, there was virtually no <strong>loose end</strong> despite
    having so many subplots going on at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add the cherry on top, they even managed to slide in a top-notch space
    battle in the late game for hype material,{" "}
    <em>but that's not even all to it.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    While these events run discretely, they can still{" "}
    <strong>interlink </strong>one another from a bird-eye view, which is pretty
    sick as I've always enjoyed this kind of multi-scale, multi-layered level of
    storytelling.

    One of the best things about Seikai no Senki II is the strong presence of
    the <strong>opposing </strong>faction, which{" "}
    <em>barely had any focus in the earlier works</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this act, the context can be messy at first glance, but there's more to
    it than meets the eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the beginning, I wholeheartedly thought it was a bad idea to include{" "}
    <em>so many different viewpoints</em>, <strong>four </strong>to be more
    specific, from extra new side characters.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, as the curtain unveils the whole picture, everything makes perfect
    sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    For real, no matter how hard I tried to find a hole in their logic, it
    really can't be helped that things ended up this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each side has its <strong>motive</strong>, <strong>reasoning</strong>, and{" "}
    <strong>circumstance </strong>to justify its actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never thought I'd be invested in these four temporarily introduced
    factions in this act.
  </p>
  <p>
    In all honesty, some of them can be flawed, such as, uhhhh,{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>
        capturing women for the sake of having children just because they want
        to see kids running joyfully in a hellhole
      </em>
    </strong>
    , but I digress.

    What matters here IMO is how it grants these characters a{" "}

    Moving on to the main cast, I cannot describe how well they were handled.
  </p>
  <p>
    I never really liked Jinto as a character early on, for he seems too
    ordinary and, well, kind of a wimp lol.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, SnS II pretty much <strong>solidified his ideal</strong> and
    position in the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is well aware of his shortcomings yet continued to{" "}
    <em>stay firm to himself</em>, and yeah, I pretty much enjoy his decisions
    in this act as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though they appear to be <strong>naive</strong>,{" "}
    <em>there's no sign of ill-will</em>, which is cool. Furthermore, his tiny
    bit of <strong>internal conflict</strong> between being originally a lander
    and his current position as an Abh noble is a nice touch to his character.

    That said, Lafiel stole the spotlight for me,{" "}
    <em>and I'm not even fanboying, </em>
    <strong>yet</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would not be a stretch to say she had undergone the most sophisticated{" "}
    <strong>transformation as a character</strong> in the whole series.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spanning across the entire season, we get to see Lafiel{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>in a myriad of emotional states</em>
    </strong>
    , such as chilling, fury, resolve, melancholy, sadness, despair, and hope.

    Looking back at the <strong>Lafiel from Crest of the Star</strong>, she sure
    has come a long way.
  </p>
  <p>
    From being a <strong>yolo-ish </strong>young lady who had a propensity
    toward rash acts to the <strong>Lafiel of Banner II</strong> with a highly
    calm attitude filled with rational thoughts and decisive mindset, but not
    without compassion and, of course, soft nature inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    WOW, it simply boggles the mind. In the end, I guess what truly sold me on
    Lafiel and Jinto is <em>how well they are meant to be for each other</em>,
    fr, <em>just get married already lmao.</em>

    Other than that, admiral Spoor did not disappoint despite being a supporting
    character. Part of the reason is that she has a bit of privilege for playing
    a <strong>crucial role </strong>in this act.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless, I can't get enough of the constant switching between her{" "}
    <strong>trolling </strong>and <strong>no non-sense</strong> mode, which is
    hilarious and awesome at the same time.

    Apart from that, her capability as a commander is but pure{" "}
    <strong>elegance</strong>, for she truly{" "}
    <em>lived up to her reputation and hype </em>teased early on. It would be a
    lie to say I was not fired up whenever her fleet is on a roll.

    The other admirals have their quirks. Still, I feel like the time spent on
    them is a bit excessive with so many lengthy <strong>random </strong>talks
    that barely add anything to the plot. Nonetheless, the cast of SnS II
    overall is very <strong>diverse </strong>and<strong> </strong>well-built
    backed up by compelling interactions.

    Visual-wise, given the <em>limited resources </em>in the early 2000s, SnS II
    is quite <strong>ahead of its time</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aspect ratio bump from<strong> 4:3</strong> to<strong> 16:9</strong> is
    hands down the most welcomed change ever.

    In truth, some scenes rely on reusing old sequences. However, the directing
    is basically <em>on steroids</em> when it comes to moments of truth and
    climax.

    As a space opera anime, it is no surprise that SnS will feature{" "}
    <strong>majestic spaceships</strong> to cater to sci-fi enthusiasts. For
    something that came out in early 2000, I must say it is a bit{" "}

    Furthermore, a <strong>commander's perspective </strong>from a higher plane

    Lastly, the creator even went to extra mile to explain the{" "}
    <strong>mechanism </strong>behind the sci-fi concepts of SnS with
    spectacular animation sequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    The prime example of this is <strong>Basroil's battle configuration</strong>{" "}
    moment, which showcases the launching logic of the assault spaceship, legit
    the most '<strong>kino</strong>' moment to me in this anime as it{" "}
    <em>incorporates so many factors in a short span of nearly 1 minute.</em>

  <p>
    To put it bluntly, they know how to make the most out of this track since it
    is usually played at the turning point of the main characters, thus{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>further deepen the already desolated atmosphere.</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>On a side note, the BGMs are rather powerful assets of SnS II.</p>
  <p>
    To be more specific, they're not just there for the sake of having music but
    rather to serve as an <strong>indication </strong>that{" "}
    <em>something sinister or theatrical is about to commence,</em> or at least
    implied in those particular scenes.
  </p>
  <p>
    This goes double when a <strong>closure </strong>to certain moments was
    drawing near; as the music kicked in, I could not help but YOOOOOOOOOO.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for voice acting, it's pretty standard for the most part, I'd say. The
    cast is relatively big, yet not all have frequent appearances, so I can't
    comment much here.
  </p>
  <p>
    If anything,
    <em>
      {" "}
      the switch between the <strong>Abh language</strong> and{" "}
    </em>
    <strong>
      <em>Japanese</em>{" "}
    </strong>
    at some pivotal scenes can be very wholesome indeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from that, Lafiel's VA did an incredible job capturing some of the
    most <strong>refined expressions</strong> on top of the various{" "}
    <strong>emotional outburst</strong> periods.
  </p>
  <p>
    It goes without saying that one moment
    <strong>
      <em> </em>
    </strong>
    <em>
      where all that is left on the screen is but Lafiel's heavy breathing in
      tandem with a surreal time-frozen atmosphere
    </em>{" "}
    is easily the peak of this anime's VA performance.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      This was doubtless the longest 10 seconds of Lafiel's life, "suffocating"

    Throughout the journey, I got to experience a plethora of reactions.{" "}

    ceased to keep me on edge all the time.
  </p>

    And just as I thought everything was already over when the end credit
