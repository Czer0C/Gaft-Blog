    <h3>
      <b>[SPOILERS FOR BOTH SERIES SO BEWARE]</b>
    </h3>
  </center>
  <p>
    Shingeki no Kyoujin or Attack on Titan is most likely not something so
    foreign to many people in the 2D community as of late. While the manga is
    reaching its conclusion, the anime adaptations on the other hand have been
    causing quite an uproar mostly because of the huge stack of OSTs.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, though I’ve been following this series for a long time, I
    wasn’t so invested in it to a considerable extent till recently. What got me
    curious is the fact that the author Isayama was inspired by Muv-luv, which
    is also a pretty massive franchise on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I kept thinking about SnK as a whole, a lot of this makes sense to me,
    and I’ve decided to do a fun breakdown to point out some similarities or
    parallels between these two “Titanic” works.

    <h2>
      <b>TSF – The 9 Titans</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    People often meme the 9 Titans in SnK as “meat mecha”. That might sound
    hilarious in the beginning but in time this is pretty accurate given the
    mechanism behind a Titan and “Mecha” in general (like urgh, having someone
    “piloting” or controlling it).
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  <p>
    The mecha (or TSF) in Muv-luv plays a crucial role in the story but not
    without a lot of background information, deep history, and some cultural
    references.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Titan in SnK in the same veins were polished to being more than just
    some sort of tools to move the plot or hype things up, which is very cool.
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>Coup D’etat – Uprising</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    For the majority of the build-up segment, both SnK and Muv-luv illustrated
    the tragic struggle of “humanity” against foreign/alien beings.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, at some point of the ride, both suddenly shifted to a completely
    different tone that also entails something arguably more menacing, namely
    human vs human, or basically fighting against one’s own kin.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"

    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Though the direction of SnK in the 2nd half has completely switched over
    this kind of conflict, the reason why I specifically chose the Uprising arc
    from SnK as a reference is that it has a lot of relations with the Coup in
    MLA.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, they both feature a character with some mysterious background who
    turned out to be of high prestige or royalty and involved the “government”
    that had been running behind the scene for some time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another nice parallelism is the theme invoked from these stories is freedom
    or simply “taking control over one’s life”.

    <h2>
      <b>Sumika – Historia</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    This one might come up as a bit biased on my part but the general ideas I
    have between these two characters are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Initially portrayed as meek, fragile, and seemingly “unimportant” to plot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gained incredible momentum at the mid-game and rise up to the rank of
      those who are capable of shaking the story.
    </li>
    <li>Turned the tide of the romance battle:</li>
    <li>
      For Sumika, she had been absent for more or less half the duration of the
      entire story (Unlimited and half of Alternative) before making a comeback
      with quite a twist.
    </li>
    <li>
      For Historia, let’s be honest, nobody expected a “side” character with
      barely any information, in the beginning, to be this deeply involved with
      the MC lol.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>
      <b>Quantum Causality – Path</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    These two concepts might not have anything to do with each other but judging
    on their impact on their respective plot, I do believe there are some
    noticeable patterns to decipher.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Path” is used to close the gap between the past and the future in SnK,
    whereas Quantum Causality is an instrument to “connect” all of the
    world-line or “routes” in MLA. Not to mention the <strong>Telepathy</strong>{" "}
    vs <strong>Causality Information Leak</strong> thingy that triggered
    mindfucking revelations or some sort.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"

    <h2>
      <b>Mana – Levi</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Lastly, these two characters are what I’d like to call the walking hax in
    their respective verse. Apart from being hype machines and packing insane
    combat capabilities, they even have a similar lean build, strict manner, a
    no-nonsense attitude, their lineage as a guard or protector to important
    figures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, at some point in the story, both were forced to make the hard
    call, such as being placed in a scenario where they are left with no choice
    but to slay their comrades (kinda).
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"

      height={1485}
      loading="lazy"
      width={1485}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    And before anyone says anything, yes underneath that stone-cold, killing
    machine appearance, these two awesome characters have never forsaken their
    human parts at all. The world might come to an end at any moment and while
    their job requires extreme concentration and a serious mindset, it doesn’t
    mean they can’t enjoy little things in life.

    <h2>
      <b>Bottom Line</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    To wrap this up, I just thought that it’d be cool to compare these two
    franchises together in some sense and ended up finding quite some intriguing
    details that help me appreciate each of them more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do note that I didn’t make this post to prove that SnK is a ripped-off story
    whatsoever. The concepts and world-building of MLA are vastly different from
    those of SnK, so just treat these parallels as fun coincidences.
