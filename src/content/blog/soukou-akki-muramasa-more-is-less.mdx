  <p>
    Anyhow, here it is, Muramasa. The legendary visual novel. The "masterpiece"
    hailed by many. The beast that boasts insurmountable{" "}
    <strong>challenges </strong>for any reader.
  </p>
  <p>
    And of course,{" "}
    <em>
      with that comes the risk of <strong>overpromising</strong>.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    In truth, I actually enjoyed this game. It's undoubtedly one of the most
    whimsical rides that I've had for some time.

    I mean, it has <strong>almost</strong> everything one can ask for in a
    visual novel, namely, rich world-building, prolific cast, engaging choice
    format, a splendid vault of sublime CG, creative route system that{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>leverages its own plot-point</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    (a big plus in my book), and above all else, sleek and dynamic action
    sequences that never failed to deliver the hype and excitement especially
    for thrillseekers like me.

      Unexpectedly, something unforeseeable had emerged and sealed off my
      ability to appreciate Muramasa wholeheartedly.

  <p>
    Simply put, at some point around the <strong>halfway </strong>point of the
    story, <em>I no longer found any interest</em> in unraveling whatever aces
    the game had up its sleeve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Funny though, it has nothing to do with how, by sheer dumb luck or
    coincidence,{" "}
    <em>I had managed to decipher the late-game secret wayyyy early on</em>.
    Regardless, the continual <strong>red herring</strong> was pretty silly and

    The long and drawn-out battles <strong>played no part</strong> in crippling
    my experience of Muramasa either. If anything, I've always been a fan of
    intricate and well-thought-out war stories featuring complex flows.

    Not to mention the hype exerted from a myriad of elements as a skirmish
    raged on throughout the story.

  <p>
    Moreover, they did make good use of the{" "}
    <strong>visual novel format </strong>(once again proof of the master race)
    to enhance the climax with fancy graphical effects and nifty directing to
    keep the readers on edge.

    To put it in layman's terms, each has their own drive and reasonings for
    what they do. Contentious as some might have been, it's undeniable that{" "}
    <strong>they have dedicated themselves to their paths.</strong>
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/Screenshot--432-.webp"

  <p>
    This, in effect, justifies their right to carry the mantle of the themes
    revolving around them.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, however, there are a few odd cases that suffered
    over-abstraction on top of their motives, which felt unnecessary and a bit{" "}
    <strong>pretentious.</strong>
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img

    Yet again, if none of the key elements was <strong>mainly</strong> to blame,{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>what exactly happened?</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    As I kept pressing on with the story, I finally realized something.{" "}
    <em>Muramasa had bit off more than it can chew.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, the game is epic. It definitely has countless topics to discuss and
    possesses a plethora of themes that question<strong> </strong>human{" "}
    <strong>natures</strong> and their <strong>conflicts</strong>, which is by
    no means a bad approach.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  </figure>
  <p>
    Still, did it have to go <strong>THAT </strong>far?
  </p>
  <p>
    From how I see it,{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>Muramasa had tried so hard to make a point</strong>
    </em>{" "}
    that it ended up sidelining other prominent elements teased at the early
    phase of the story, which is quite a shame tbh.

  </figure>
  <p>
    Despite trying to portray itself as an <strong>anti-pattern</strong> to
    conventional storytelling, ironically, it couldn't escape resorting to some
    of the most widely known tricks to{" "}
    <em>provoke suspense and "heartfelt" moments</em>, which in turn felt far
    from convincing. It's dumb even.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

    Apart from that, constant throwbacks to the past just won't do any good
    either.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's understandable that for a super long work like this, the readers might
    need to be reminded of essential plot points through{" "}
    <strong>flashbacks</strong>, <strong>reaffirming narratives</strong>, and
    such.

  <p>But as mentioned above, it's redundant, if not, excessive in my book.</p>

    On top of that, some of the dramatic scenes were{" "}
    <strong>over-saturated</strong> <em>without considering the context</em>,
    thus hindering its own movement in an attempt to paint an overly bleak
    picture.

    To make matters worse, the <strong>randomly </strong>inserted jokes served
    nothing but <strong>interrupting </strong>the current of the story, which
    can get inherently very annoying and cringey.

  <p>
    I don't want to sound like a hardass, but the game must have seriously
    underestimated my memory for thinking I'd fall for cheap tricks like
    deceptive narrative (talking about that you-know-what at the{" "}
    <strong>train station incident near the endgame</strong>).
  </p>
  <p>
    One can argue that the intention behind these directions isn't to induce
    tearjerking material but more about sending a message of some sort.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's fine if you perceive them that way, but frankly, the evidence is way
    too obvious for me to consider the alternative.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, the directing, the camera angle, and the music, they all there for a
    purpose, which sadly did not work on me.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-09-03_17_22_45-Full_Metal_Daemon_Muramasa_ver1.00.webp"

  <p>
    All and all, there seems to be a noticeable pattern in the way the writing
    is done, especially with how the <strong>turning points </strong>all bank on{" "}
    <em>taking things out of context </em>as the characters{" "}
    <strong>blamed </strong>themselves or got close to arriving at their{" "}
    <strong>answers</strong>, which IMO felt pretty contrived.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      To make a long story short, Muramasa knows how to raise the bar but lacks
      what it takes to answer that astronomical expectation.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    On another note,<strong> all of the random H-scenes make no sense, </strong>
    and this has nothing to do with being disturbing materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    For one thing, this is a systematic approach in trying to "spice things up",
    and <em>I failed to see the point behind all the rapes</em> (or something
    similar).
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the circumstances were already dire enough,{" "}
    <em>adding more oil to the fire</em>, in this case, would not make that much
    of a difference, in all honesty.
  </p>

    Maybe they were just trying to<em> blend in with the story's setting</em> by
    depicting one of the atrocious sides of the medieval period, a time where
    rape and pillaging are the norms.
  </p>
  <p>
    But again, it doesn't sweep away the fact that{" "}
    <strong>this motif was abused to no end</strong>, which is so irritating and
    absurd.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, I would normally not go out of my way to rant about the seemingly
    trivial matter of a game. However, exceptions tend to arise once in a while.
  </p>
  <p>
    To be blunt, they sure as hell had no idea how to invoke ease-of-use for the
    gameplay in general for something backed with a{" "}
    <strong>hefty budget</strong>.

    The controller scarcely has any feature that benefits a touch screen, which
    is not something I'd complain about if other visual novels coming out in the
    same period had not managed to achieve that result.

  <p>
    <strong>
      But that is nothing compared to the downright abhorring process of
      selecting a choice
    </strong>
    . I mean, I can't just fathom the idea of having to wait for 5s before it's fully
    ready for choosing. Therefore, when it comes to specific segments that involve
    A LOT of choices, I could not help but felt utterly infuriated.

    Another technical flaw I've encountered is that, occasionally, the
    characters' sprite in the background would not match that in the dialogue

    It would not be a lie to say I did not get any chills from it, and the
