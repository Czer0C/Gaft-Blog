      <b>Premise</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    To many people, Vivy Fluorite is an intricate series featuring an
    enthralling plot filled with <em>twist after twist</em> and a very{" "}
    <strong>charming </strong>protagonist, Vivy.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I myself have also been entranced by those factors, to me, it is the{" "}
    <strong>sound design</strong> of this anime that truly elevated the show. In
    effect,{" "}
    <em>this sets it a cut above other contenders in the same season.</em>

  <p>
    For once, I'm not criticizing the plot of Vivy or its character whatsoever,
    but I just feel like the brilliance of its sound system isn't received{" "}
    <strong>well enough</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, Vivy does have sick animation sequences, it does have neat directing
    to leverage the dramas, and the narrative is engaging, ambitious even, the
    characters are no doubt to my liking whether they are bad or good.
  </p>
  <p>Yet again, sound design &gt;&gt;, nuff said.</p>

    <h2>
      <b>OP</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    What can I say<strong>, Sing My Pleasure</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>Galaxy Anthem</strong>. For <strong>SMP</strong>, we get two
    versions of the track, one by Vivy herself (my favorite version btw), and
    the other by <strong>Grace</strong>, an unfortunate being in the series that
    probably suffered the most from the A.I's perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>"They are just music</em>", you might be thinking. Yes, but no. They are
    music that carries a lot of <strong>vigor </strong>within as you keep
    watching Vivy.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the <strong>first </strong>version of this tune, you take it as your
    typical idol-ish, cheerful song that is more or less just another ordinary
    asset, an introduction of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, the <strong>lyrics</strong>, <em>there's something behind it</em>
    . I, too, felt like something was amiss as I stumbled upon this mesmerizing
    melody.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the creator sure is savage. <em>Before you knew it, </em>
    <strong>they hit you where it hurts the most.</strong> Ultimately, you can hardly
    ever receive this OP in a <strong>light-hearted</strong> manner as your initial
    impression dictated.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for the 2nd OP, Galaxy Anthem, it is a <strong>slightly </strong>
    different breed than SMP I'd say. Technically speaking, it does radiate a positive
    aura like SMP, but beyond that, there's more <strong>confidence </strong>condensed
    in this track.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-embed-card">

    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Bluntly put, this song is here to <em>resonate </em>with a sudden{" "}
    <strong>character "shift" </strong>as the story progresses. You can most
    likely feel that the <em>good ol' Vivy is in there</em>, yet at the same
    time, something is telling you otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    To me, SMP's tone suggests that Vivy has <strong>doubt </strong>for herself
    which somehow gives leeway for Galaxy Anthem to act as a
    <strong> foil</strong> for that notion, a perfect harmony, I'd say.
  </p>

  <p>
    IMO, an idol show cannot be deemed as such without prolific singers serving
    as its backbone, and Vivy Fluorite had just managed to achieve that status.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensemble for Polaris (also 2 versions ðŸ˜³)</li>
    <li>Elegy Dedicated With Love</li>
    <li>Harmony of One's Heart.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Put bluntly, every one of these tracks has its own{" "}
    <strong>purpose, </strong>and they get even better (and{" "}
    <em>more painful</em>) as far as we take the context of their own story into
    consideration.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Polaris, it's about being <strong>free </strong>or having one's own will
    (at least that's how I interpret it). For Elegy, it's about{" "}
    <strong>obsession </strong>(rip Ophelia). For Harmony, it's about saying{" "}
    <strong>goodbye</strong>.

    I mean, c'mon, at this moment, right now of writing this,{" "}
    <strong>I'm still having chills</strong> thinking back about all of those{" "}
    <em>dramatic outcomes of certain arcs</em>. Of course, as{" "}
    <strong>standalone </strong>instances, they are all great tracks, make good{" "}
    <em>therapeutic material</em> even.

      Yet again, this is not <strong>JUST</strong> about composing a nice piece
      of music or having a dedicated singer anymore, but more so about giving
      them a <strong>goal</strong>, just so they can shine very brightly on the
      "stage" without being treated as mere decors.

    Boi, I must be on the minority here, but all of the time when an exposition
    or revelation is going on, as the ambient music kicks in, the entire{" "}
    <strong>atmosphere</strong> of the anime shifts to an entirely different
    tone.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are there to <strong>emphasize </strong>an event, to{" "}
    <strong>trigger </strong>up a sequence or chain reaction that is also
    wrapped up in a strange phenomenon, a bit uplifting, I'd say.

    Sure, they are not important, probably of least significance to the anime in
    fact. Nonetheless, there's something captivating about it that I just can't
    explain well enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    It feels like when you travel to beautiful places to have some time off, and
    there might have come some moments of your life when you stand in front of
    scenery so "surreal" that you just <strong>do nothing and enjoy it</strong>,
    it's like a complete "blank" period of your life.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, that very same energy overflew inside me as Vivy constantly
    flexed its grandiose arsenal of BGMs.

    I guess these ambient tracks <em>just fit so well with the </em>
    <strong>
      <em>setting </em>
    </strong>
    <em>of Vivy</em>, which features a strong, futuristic, and utopia (mixing
    semi-dystopia) vibe. This is what I'd like to call quality{" "}
    <em>customer service as</em> they don't do things half-assedly. In Vivy,{" "}
    <strong>every detail, every small component is treated with care</strong>,
    and the BGM speaks volumes in this regard.

    <h2>
      <b>ED</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Last but totally not least, the infamous ED that <em>almost nobody</em>{" "}
    could ever predict its impact on the series as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    I must say, though, this was indeed a <strong>500IQ play</strong> from the
    creator.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>They had us all fooled from the get-go</em>, camouflaging this{" "}
    <strong>instrument </strong>of the series with a simple and relaxing
    non-vocal track. To top it off, they even placed it right{" "}
    <em>at the end</em> of each episode, where barely anyone would ever give
    attention to.
  </p>
  <p>
    And then, <em>they just had to do it</em>... BAMM, outta nowhere, you get a
    disgustingly <strong>grim </strong>version of it right at the turning point
    of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who could have ever seen that coming? It would not be a lie to say it still
    gives me the creep even now.
  </p>
  <p>
    But you know what they say, at the end of the tunnel, there's light, and the{" "}
    <em>light</em>
    <strong> </strong>that is to come is no doubt the <strong>
      <em>fully voiced</em>
    </strong> version of this ED, the one track to end it all (NGL I'm so hyped rn
    ðŸ”¥).

      For this particular anime, the "sound" element{" "}
      <strong>
        doesn't stop at having a concise goal and purpose in the story anymore
      </strong>
      , but it even <em>"invades"</em> the meta by having a translucent structure
      to squeeze out the absolute most of its potential and value, which is, I must
      say, an excellent decision from the production team.
      <br />
      <br />
      Not only did it break the cycle of{" "}
      <strong>"adding music just for the sake of adding music"</strong>, but it
      also delivered a rarely seen side of anime, which is to use sound as a
      reliable foundation for almost everything else in the series (well, it's
      still an idol show in the end so lel).
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>
      <b>Technical</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    On a different note, while being a heavily music-centric anime, Vivy
    Fluorite knows how to get its priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sound is sound, it's only a means to an end, which is why it's crucial{" "}
    <strong>knowing how to use them </strong>rather than cranking them up
    without any plan nor consideration for the context of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, <em>the volume is toned down at battle scenes</em>, just so
    they won't <strong>overshadow </strong>the actual content that's running on
    the screen.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-embed-card">

      width={200}
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    Or, given the circumstance of an event, sound <strong>distortion </strong>
    was also put into good use to <strong>
      highlight the tragedy or bitterness
    </strong> of the grand scheme of things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Timing is also of <em>paramount importance</em>, especially when the flow of
    the event needs to be coherent.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      TLDR: having the right material (composer, voice actors) + solid planning
      + seamless execution = The Hegemony of Sound Design in Vivy Fluorite.
    </p>
  </div>
  <center>
    <h2>
      <b>Bottom Line</b>
    </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Phew, writing this post reminds me that, despite having gone through
    countless mediocre anime, I still hold this medium in very high esteem for
    the <em>infinite amount of potentials </em>it has underneath.
  </p>
  <p>
    More importantly,{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>
        there's something only this medium can afford to accomplish
      </strong>
    </em>
    , and Vivy Fluorite is but a prime example of my belief.
