    <h3>[SPOILERS WARNING]</h3>

  <h1 id="context">Context</h1>
  <p>
    Getting back to the Steins;Gate series (including <strong>0 </strong>and
    their respective<strong> </strong>vn and anime) was a rather surreal
    experience, to say the least. Initially, excitement was all over the place
    since this is a franchise that more or less contributed to my early phase as
    an anime fan when literally everything was an instant 10/10 watch for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, as soon as the rewatch commenced, a sense of unease slowly crawled
    its way inside me. That was when I realized something, that is, with every
    new anime/manga/novel that I consumed, my sense of criticism would grow as a
    result.
  </p>
  <p>
    To stop beating around the bush, I just really don't want to toss away
    another one of my OG series for this has actually occurred on several other
    works I've been revisiting.
  </p>

  <p>
    But such a worrywart I was. Steins;Gate has demonstrated itself to be
    capable of nullifying the corrosion of time, something only a few major
    titles could ever accomplish. Of course, I'm not claiming that this series
    has no flaws, but just as I've expressed myself in the Baldr Sky post,
    dedication is the keyword here, and the people responsible for this
    phenomenal series had truly outdone themselves by crafting such a timeless
    classic.
  </p>
  <h1 id="the-og">The OG</h1>
  <p>
    Admittedly, there're plenty of exploits to make the story advance the way
    the author wants them to be. However, before they proceed there's always an
    extensive exposition in place to make sure the audience would follow or at
    least have a grasp of what to come next. Nonetheless, that would be the
    lesser concern in this infamous series.
  </p>
  <p>
    More than often, in attempts of lightening up the mood, S;G would mix in a
    lot of chuuni talks (coming from the esteemed protagonist of course ðŸ˜‚),
    western culture references or memes, and blatant sex jokes which could
    either work or backfire entirely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regardless, I don't have much issue with that approach since I'm also one
    who has spent (way too much) time on the Internet so it's kinda relatable in
    a sense, and ngl the chuuni shit might be cringey at the beginning but
    turned out to be quite addictive as I kept putting up with Okabe's nonsense
    lol.
  </p>
  <p>
    The slice of life segments in the early game might serve as friction for the
    real deal to come. I mean, I'm aware that not many people have the patience
    to sit through a fair amount of time just to see characters doing their very
    down-to-earth things without anything grandiose going under the hood
    whatsoever. But to me, this is also a necessary build-up to fully appreciate
    the radical impact of the twist to come out from mid to late game.

    As time travel is the central point of the series, this effectively paved
    the way for a variety of diverse themes to arise and supplement the story
    with spice and substance. The most prominent one in this regard is{" "}
    <strong>facing the consequences of your action</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This does not strictly apply to the butterfly effect thingy, but more so
    about how well you should be aware of your surrounding as you keep up with
    your daily banter and habit, which might eventually pile up and create
    unwanted side effects to yourself, or worse, those dear ones who also happen
    to be next to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from that, <strong>never rejecting the past</strong> brought forth an
    interesting antithesis to the whole deal with time travel. Like, normally
    when you think of it this topic it's mostly about <strong>undoing</strong>{" "}
    the mistakes you've done right?

  <p>
    But here, to reach the true ending, S;G brilliantly (or should I say
    mischievously) came up with a roundabout way to propose an alternative,
    which worked out really well from how I see it.
  </p>

      This extends to Kurisu's refusing to send a D-mail, for that would be the
      same as denying who she was, neat stuff.

  <p>
    With all said and done, when it comes to the cast of Steins;Gate, things can
    be tricky. Sure, many of them suffered little to no development but
    sometimes I can just make do with a fun and wholesome characters like these.
    Okabe and Kurisu are no doubt the main stars of the entire story, but over
    the time I had found the secondary cast to be very endearing and comfortable
    to sit through as well (on top of having unlimited meme potentials kek).
  </p>

  <p>
    Still, if I have to name a few noteworthy ones, it has got to be Daru and
    Suzuha who at first appear to be kinda weirdos but damn the more the story
    progressed the better they got (that Suzuha ending tho ðŸ¤¯). Mayuri could be
    up there but sadly she was destined to be a liability to plot so rip (didn't
    mind the tutuuru spam tho)
  </p>
  <p>
    And to put the cherry on top, Steins;Gate was blessed to be backed by a
    hefty production value. Be it in visual novel format or the anime
    adaptation, I'd go as far as saying it was invested really well to present
    the story in its finest form.
  </p>
  <p>
    To further elaborate, the visual novel offers more interaction with texting
    and calling features, which in the end is just another form of "picking" a
    choice like every vn out there but regardless it was still a lot more
    enjoyable and refreshing than relying on the usual approach.

    Meanwhile, the anime went out of its way to polish character interaction,
    giving them more nuances to solidify their already established image in the
    source material, which is cool.

  <h1 id="zero">Zero</h1>
  <p>
    Steins;Gate 0 might have certain issues with its plotline and failed to live
    up to the OG's reputation but I really dig the thematic expansion from time
    travel to AI and human memories since the former is quite trendy lately
    while the latter hasn't seen much explorations in 2d media.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption">

    Furthermore, Imo, what Zero lacked in plot, it made it up with character
    polishing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Put simply, Maho is arguably the best addition to the franchise period. I
    mean, the way she works resonates greatly with me, and that "YOU ARE YOU"
    talk with the girls was straight up her spitting fire. Not to mention she
    had some seriously intriguing chemistry with some other characters. Her
    inferiority against Kurisu was covered pretty well, shit basically convinced
    me to watch the film Amadeus and it was a wild one. Her friendship with
    Moeka in Twin Automata basically made me go ape shit (I'm still a bit mad
    about how wasted Moeka got near the end though). Lastly, I'd say her dynamic
    with Okabe was really on point despite their occasional clashing ideas which
    go well with the mood of Zero (
    <em>but of course, Kurisu is still the bezt grill</em>)

    Kagari is probably where things get seriously complicated, I understand why
    many people would hate her but part of me would like to blame the writing
    associated with her plot rather than the character in question, simply put
    she was forced to go potato mode for 90% of the time and when things get a
    bit brighter for her she just switches to moe, clumsy type which kinda makes
    it incompatible. That said I don't really feel anything negative towards
    Kagari since she's a factor of important role in deciding the path to
    Steins;Gate.

    Other than that, Leskinen was kinda wasted as a potential S-class villain.
    There needed to be more focus on him to make his motive and action more
    profound in any sense (tho the anime did a better job at portraying his
    twisted view), a shame{" "}
    <em>but at least the shaman girl meme was pretty solid</em>.
  </p>
  <h1 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h1>
  <p>
    So yeah, as mentioned above, a visit that was meant for me to re-evaluate
    this franchise turned out to be a trip of self-realization and a bit of
    reaffirmation as well. Though it is true that it was the plot that defined
    Steins;Gate, whenever I see the cast of Steins;Gate going on their usual
    silly routine, I just could not help but laugh and felt a rare, tingling
    sense of satisfaction and as the end credit rolled I found myself wishing
    for a little bit more content of this amazing series.
