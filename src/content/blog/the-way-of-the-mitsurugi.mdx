  <p>
    It is pretty funny to think that my expectation was{" "}
    <strong>near zero</strong> when I first delved into Muv-Luv.
  </p>
  <p>
    All I knew beforehand was that this thing was sitting at the top of vndb,
    and that's it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn't care about what hype it got. I didn't care about the Kickstarter
    project that raised quite an amount of funds either (ROFL). On top of that,
    I didn't care about what year it came out and what version it had, lmao.
  </p>
  <p>
    What I did were a few mundane things. To be more specific, I went on the
    Internet, <em>dug up some links</em>, downloaded, and fired this thing up
    (oof, a blatant admission of guilt, but I did buy the Steam version later
    on, I swear).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I had even planned to play this game 100% blind</strong>, in fact
    (looking back, I really should have, feck it), but time wasn't on my side,
    so welp.
  </p>
  <p>
    All said and done. Before I caught my sense of it,
    <em> I had already found myself being overwhelmed</em> by so many <strong>
      HRRRRNNNNNGGG{" "}
    </strong>moments of this VN.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the <em>ridiculously high production value</em> of this VN was
    partially the <em>culprit</em>, there was one particular existence that{" "}
    <em>refused to let me take my eyes off her</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, yeah, to some people, she's a <em>pretty standard </em>heroine with
    good ol' trope and a bit of fleshing out in the horrendous setting of
    BETA-verse to make herself stand out<em> a little bit </em>more than the
    norm.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, to me, she is that one{" "}
    <em>
      <strong>guiding light</strong>{" "}
    </em>
    that enlightened me in lots of &nbsp;fucking amazing ways that <em>
      I never thought I had needed
    </em>.
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      Her name is <strong>Mitsurugi Meiya</strong>, born a daughter of a
      powerful noble house, lived as a disposable political tool, and died a
      free person.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    What really defines Meiya's character is that,{" "}
    <em>despite all the injustice inflicted upon her</em>, she still held her
    head high and <strong>embraced </strong>all of that as if they were trivial
    matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such is the embodiment of <strong>duty</strong>, a rare trait to find in
    anything related to 2D culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    Her theme is the difference between <strong>living</strong> and{" "}
    <strong>being kept alive</strong>, which doubtlessly stands out from almost
    anything else that could be offered in this franchise, IMO.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though she <em>never displayed any sign of contempt</em> against the way
    things were, the tears she shed upon receiving the
    <strong>
      <em>doll</em>
    </strong>
    is her genuine feeling<strong> </strong>regarding the separation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      No matter how one looks at it,{" "}
      <strong>Meiya was but a teenage girl</strong>.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    She is not a robot who will <em>blindly follow orders</em>, nor a soulless
    being who would grind her teeth and <em>suffer in silence.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    She most likely had things that she wanted to accomplish as a normal girl,
    like hanging out with friends, touring the big world, or maybe doing
    something as simple as having a good time with a sister (*sob*).
  </p>
  <p>
    Admittedly, to see Meiya filled with regret like that, I too could all but
    be drowned in my own lamentations. Almost no word was ushered during{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>that </em>
    </strong>
    moment, but her expression alone is enough to tell the whole picture.
  </p>
  <p>
    When her rights had been dictated by others, what else could she do to make
    her life counted as <em>"truly living"</em>?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Love </strong>could be one answer.
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, fate had once again turned its back on Meiya.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Regardless of what she did to Takeru</em>, like how she always stayed by
    his side, supported him, lifted him up, and even willingly gave away her
    pride as a woman to get him back on track,{" "}
    <strong>her feelings had never reached Takeru</strong>, for whatever reason
    it was.
  </p>
  <p>
    It could be that Sumika's influence on Takeru is too astronomical. Or Takeru
    was basically that <em>dense </em>to realize, because hey, if it took more
    than a <strong>decade </strong>before Sumika finally got close to Takeru,
    then <strong>two months</strong> would have probably been hopeless for Meiya
    from the start.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet again, what did she do after being sidetracked like that? Of course, her
    head still held high, and her pride stood still as if it would only wither
    when the Earth did so.
  </p>
  <p>
    What's more, not once did she even think about using <em>shortcuts </em>to
    get to Takeru, nor did she ever resort to <em>underhanded tricks</em> in the
    competition against Sumika.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given how Meiya was portrayed, she most likely wished to win over Takeru{" "}
    <strong>straightforwardly </strong>and not rely on anything deemed as
    "convenient."
  </p>
  <p>
    And just like that, everything she did, she did it fair and square, in that
    "battle" as it had been in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a <strong>golden opportunity</strong> presented right in front of her
    eye, she tossed it away and aided in mending the bond between Takeru and
    Sumika instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      It would not be a stretch to call Meiya a fool in that pivotal event.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    From my viewpoint, when it comes to love competition, there's no such thing
    as <strong>unfair </strong>advantages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose that she had used that <em>opening </em>to gain Takeru's affection,
    nobody could have ever complained, or at least they could understand.
  </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, this is when Meiya truly shone as a tragic heroine.</p>
  <p>
    Logically speaking, it would not have been a wrong decision of hers to
    advance towards Takeru.
  </p>
  <p>But Meiya is no ordinary girl.</p>
  <p>
    She was molded in a strict environment{" "}
    <strong>
      <s>(Mana hype)</s>
    </strong>{" "}
    and greatly influenced by the Bushido way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Naturally, Meiya would never allow herself to commit such dishonorable
    deeds, even if it came at the price of having herself mentally devastated,
    which had also been foreshadowed earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the hour was upon her, Meiya had to withstand yet another detrimental
    blow to her <strong>resolve</strong>, which was to witness the man she loves
    flirting with her mortal love rival.
  </p>
  <p>
    With her reaction being vivid this time, Meiya's heart was certainly
    shattered.
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be a lie to say I was not in denial for a long time, close to 100
    hours of reading this story, in fact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Needless to say, I had no other option but to open my eyes and face the
    reality that
    <em>
      <strong> Meiya never had a chance</strong>
    </em>
    in this endeavor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not since Alternative, nor Unlimited, but right in Extra. Do note that I
    don't hate Sumika for any of that. She's all good, though I used to hate her
    'cause of other reasons XD.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyhow, my point being, things had been set in stone from the very first
    stage of the story. The role of the girl known as Mitsurugi Meiya would
    always be to remain a <strong>shadow, </strong>left in the dark, unwanted,
    unnecessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    And YET AGAIN, <strong>she did not faze.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If anything, her face burned clear, even at the gate of hell. Without a
    single shred of hesitation or regret, she asked the man she loves to pull
    the trigger and send her to her grave.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Humans can't choose how they were born, but they can choose how to meet
      their ends.
    </p>
    <cite>
      <strong>Tsukuyomi Mana</strong>
    </cite>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    There is no mistake that Meiya was indeed "living" her own life in that
    short-lived Sakura operation, no longer bound by any of the injustice she
    had been through before that.
  </p>
  <p>
    During her final moment, the last thing that flashed through Meiya wasn't
    that which she loved, but that which she wanted to <strong>protect</strong>,
    that which she held dear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, it was, surprisingly, Kouubin Yuuhi,<strong> </strong>not as the
    <strong> Shogun</strong>, but as <strong>Meiya's flesh and blood</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally, I find this scene to be the most poignant sight to behold in the
    entirety of the trilogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    It neither felt forced nor came out of the blue, given how the sisters had
    been through during the Coup D'etat (in a subtle way).
  </p>
  <div className="special-quote">
    <p className="g-grid__text">
      Looking back at Meiya's journey again, as she got{" "}
      <strong>rejected</strong> by her old family, <strong>rejected</strong> by
      the government, and <strong>rejected</strong> by the man who stole her
      heart away, who could she possibly turn to in such a desperate situation?
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Somehow my mind pictures a scene of a young and crying Meiya running towards
    Yuuhi when she was in trouble.{" "}
    <em>That is what sisters are for, aren't they?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    All and all, though Meiya endured a variety of hardships, she had always
    remained herself, still with that same noble act, still with that same
    naivety, and still with that same smile on her face.
  </p>
  <p>
    IMO, everything about Meiya was handled with nuances. From how messed up her
    life was to her <strong>pain</strong> of falling in love and her reason for{" "}
    <strong>"being alive."</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, since her character was designed to be one who seeks no reward in
    her deeds, the name Mitsurugi Meiya serves as a shining beacon for those who
    face <strong>destiny</strong> head-on regardless of how cruel it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a different note, I can agree that Meiya's character is undoubtedly{" "}
    <em>far too good to be true.</em> It's ridiculous even.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way she went out of her way to resist <em>temptations </em>and retain
    her <em>moral code</em> even at the darkest hours cannot be, in all honesty,
    deemed as practical. I'd say she's more of a <strong>living ideal </strong>
    than a human being.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nonetheless, Muv-Luv is a work of fiction; therefore,
    <strong>
      {" "}
      I don't think it matters whether if she is unrealistic as a character or not.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    And you can never tell, should humanity face a similar crisis in the far
    future, what guarantees that there won't exist such noble souls as Meiya?
  </p>
  <p>But I digress.</p>
  <p>
    None of that is of relevancy because, from how I see it,{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>Meiya just fits in the setting of Muv-Luv.</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    She's there to remind me that there are many things out there that I should
    try and <em>stop taking for granted</em>. I really owe her a great deal to
    that.
  </p>
  <p>
    AAhhhhh, when I first made the draft for this long-ass rambling post, it was
    2 am, on the rooftop of my house. I kept asking myself why and how in the
    actual f*** did I have to torment myself like this.
  </p>
  <p>But what do you know, such is the power of the 2D world.</p>
  <p>
    I've been through plenty of traumatic works. Still, Muv-Luv has got to be
    the one that <em>hit me where it hurts the most</em>. And I shall have Meiya
    to thanks for that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, thank you, <strong>my best Shogun-ish Storm Vanguard.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      It was such a phenomenal experience to have you accompany me on a long and
      uncompromising journey.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>P/S</strong>: and NO, Meiya is not my waifu since that role is
    reserved for Mana and Mana alone. Meiya is more a precious one to me, kind
    of like that{" "}
