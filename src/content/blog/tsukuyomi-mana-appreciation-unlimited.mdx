    Unlimited was longer than I remembered but that is without a doubt more to
    my liking as I could wholeheartedly emerge myself in the Muv-Luv universe
    for a 2nd time. That goes without saying Mana continued to deliver a
    spectacular performance despite having super limited screen time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean, it's not like I expected much from her in Unlimited because as far
    as I remember in my first read, her role is negligible here. Though that is
    arguably true, I enjoyed her moments greatly for they did very well in
    establishing her "true" character for the late game of the trilogy.

    First of all, some things just never changed, Mana has always been and
    forever will be a mother figure to Meiya, regardless of the universe they
    are in. I know it's nothing grandiose, a trivial matter in fact because duh,
    what's new in A taking care of B in every way possible amirite? Nonetheless,
    to me, it's just fucking touching no matter how I look at it. It's probably
    because I already knew what was going to happen ahead but when I tried to
    negate that factor, the way Mana covered Meiya from the shadow in Unlimited
    simply struck me in awe.

    The thing is, it's not just Mana’s dedication to Meiya, but also how tactful
    she is when dealing with various scenarios that made my day. She knows what
    exactly needs to be done, tries her best not to overstep her boundary, and
    most of all has a full grasp of the situation to come up with a most fitting
    solution that benefits many sides. This just resonates with my previous
    statement in Part 1, namely how careful Mana is when it comes to dealing
    with her surroundings. She will not blindly join the fray without a plan,
    that just makes her an awesome "guardian" in many meanings possible.

    While Mana on the surface acts as a humble servant to Meiya, she does not do
    this out of mere duty, but for genuine care of Meiya's well being. Apart
    from a certain someone who will show up in Alternative, Mana is no doubt the
    only person who understands Meiya the most.

  <p>
    Although she always got Meiya’s back covered, she's fully aware that what
    Meiya needs the most isn't "protection" but someone who can accompany her to
    the end of the world, which is not something Mana can afford given the
    complicated circumstance between the UN and Imperial Japanese.

    One of the common issues that overprotective characters usually possess is
    how easily narrow-minded they can be and that might create some awkward
    situations as the story progresses. Fortunately, Mana did not turn out to be
    that case. It is true on her first meeting with Takeru things got
    unnecessarily tense but after coming this far I think it's all justified,
    not to mention she pretty much redeemed herself later on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mana had her reasons to believe why Takeru was a threat to Meiya, not just
    because of his suspicious background, which was part of Yuuko's meddling,
    but also because of Meiya's "real" position in this alternative universe.
  </p>

  <p>So did she remain that way till the end of the journey?</p>

  <p>
    Nope, Mana might be Meiya's personal hype squad but she's not unreasonable.
    Just like her Extra counterpart, she views things in a very objective manner
    and thus be able to come up with valid judgments on certain complicated
    scenarios. While Mana was originally skeptical about Takeru through her
    investigation, she did not let that cloud her judgment when things developed
    in a way that was probably outside of her prediction.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">

  </figure>
  <p>
    In other words, Mana might have seemingly come up as a shallow type of
    character whose only purpose is to "guard" but in reality, she's arguably
    one of, if not, the most observative human being in the Muv-Luv. It is
    obvious that securing Meiya's well-being is a priority to Mana but, as
    briefly mentioned above, what she truly wanted to do is give Meiya a chance
    to live her "life" to the fullest (more of this will return in Alternative).

    Mana hardly ever drops her strict demeanor down, which is just so dignified
    and fucking hype. I mean from the moment I first saw her new design in
    Unlimited I knew for a fact that she was going to be the real deal.

    The aura she exerts just simply means one thing to me: GOAT. Not only that
    but her change of tone and manner (plus the "watakushi", BOI) easily
    convinced me that she was going to be something and I WAS RIGHT (took a bit
    long to get to that point but who cares).
  </p>
  <p>
    While it felt like a complete 180-degree change compared to the Mana of
    Extra, I do believe it had been briefly foreshadowed.

    With how ridiculously resourceful and efficient the Extra-Mana was, combined
    with the hype Meiya gave her, I think it makes sense that Unlimited-Mana was
    set up to be that kind of hype character for some major events later on.

    At the very least, this "Royal Guard" retinue has been hinted to be a force
    to be reckoned with from a pretty early stage of the Muv-Luv universe. And
    for Mana who was tasked with guarding the Shogun's relatives, that speaks
    volumes of her combat capability even though she did not have any show time
    in Unlimited. Other than that, what I love the most about the "new" Mana is
    the change of her hairstyle as it gives off the image of a samurai and that
    goes super well with how TSF was introduced. Simply put:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>New badass hairstyle</li>
    <li>New badass outfit</li>
    <li>New badass strict mode</li>
    <li>New badass status as "Royal Guard"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>=&gt; GOAT material</p>
  <p>
    On a different note, throughout Unlimited, there has been a few times Mana
    managed to pull some rather weird feats, such as digging up Takeru's info
    which was covered up by Yuuko, having full view on any major event that
    related to Meiya, or simply fucking with Alternative V, a system that was
    meant to determine humanity's future.

    I mean from the premise I was under the impression that Mana is a pure
    warrior type (because Royal Guard hype), but she turned out to be quite of a
    spy herself given her crazy espionage feats above.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Yuuko has the largest brain in the Muv-Luv universe but guesses what, that
      was not enough to hide all traces from Mana (also I wonder if this is a
      reference to their brief encounter in Extra lol).

    <li>
      Having her eyes on Meiya 24/7 is probably not a big deal given her status
      but how she got her hands on info that even the people involved didn't is
      just something.

      That being said, none of the above could match Mana's effort of
      interfering with a super intricate system like Alternative V. It's pretty
      insane when I think about it. I get it that from a statistic standpoint,
      having one leak out of 100.000 entries might not be too impossible but
      we're talking about the one thing that is deciding humanity's fate so
      welp.

    Overall, I think this fits well with Mana's initial image as a ninja back in
    Extra, someone who is adept at tackling underground business...That or most
    of them are just coincidence and I was overthinking shit lol.

    Regardless, with many of the feats mentioned above, Mana sure is as
    resourceful and versatile as she had been in Extra. However, she would not
    be the "Mana" we once knew if that's all there is to her, and thanks god
    that was not the case. That strict and no-nonsense appearance did not deny
    her the ability to crack a joke or two once in a while, even though it might
    not be her intention but lol I genuinely didn't expect that.

    On top of that, though Mana cares greatly for Meiya it doesn't mean she'll
    let her do whatever she wants. She never forgot her duty as someone who sets
    the Mitsurigi back on track should they ever stray off from the right
    “path”. That is why when it comes to non-serious stuff she just casually
    returned to her "Extra" mode such as snapping at improper conduct made by
    Meiya, which is kinda cute.

    This world might be in dire need of strict and disciplined soldiers who get
    shit done, but that doesn't mean they can't have some fun once in a blue
    moon. It is essential to retain whatever's left as part of being a human
    instead of an empty shell that only knows of staying alive, so yeah I think
    this is a very intriguing detail about Mana and others in this alternative
    universe.

    Long story short, I think I've fallen in love with Mana for real before the
    re-visit was even over. She's just simply amazing, I can't think of her in
    any other way.
  </p>
  <p>
    As much a side character as she is, Kouki did a magnificent job of polishing
    and balancing out her role and personality to diversify the Muv-Luv
    universe. It's not like the rest of the cast fall short in this regard but
    Mana just kept wow-ing me left and right (yes I really sound like a broken
    record now).
  </p>
  <p>
    The main selling point for her story in Unlimited is still the bond between
    her and Meiya. It's both heartfelt and kinda cool when I look back at it as
    a whole picture. I mean, two people, not having that much of a generation
    gap (according to my investigation Mana is roughly 28 ), maintain a
    master-servant relationship on the surface but deep inside care for each
    other in their own way. Personally, I've always had a soft place for this
    kind of character interaction so this means a great deal to me especially in
    the setting of Muv-Luv.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from all the effort, Mana spent on keeping Meiya "warm", seeing her
    gentle smile after a long period of strict and dignified mode in Unlimited
    can probably help me heal some cancer in the future too.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, this should conclude the second phase of my Mana's appreciation
    thread. The next and last one would no doubt be insanely huge but until
    then.
