    What a strange phenomenon. As I was chilling on Youtube with their{" "}
    <em>auto mix</em> playlist, they just gotta drop the notorious{" "}
    <strong>Todokanai Koi</strong> OST outta nowhere (the mix was pretty weird
    ngl lol), and I'm not sure if that made my day or it was the opposite.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regardless, I just really felt the need to write something about this mildly
    depressing story, or to be more specific, the <strong>relationship </strong>
    of the trio.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, the fan-translation project for Coda is also on its way to
    the finish-line anyway (at least that's what they said), so I thought it
    would not be a bad idea to refresh my memories a bit with the{" "}
    <strong>Introductory </strong>chapter, so welp here we go.

    If you ask me, <strong>I don't think anyone was in the wrong </strong>in the
    outcome of WA2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Admittedly, I'm on<strong> team Kazusa</strong>,{" "}
    <em>yet I didn't feel any hatred nor contemporaries against Setsuna </em>
    whatsoever for what she did.
  </p>
  <p>
    If anything, I even feel bad for her after all the clusterfuck that had
    gotten the trio into. Nay, it would be more accurate to say I admire Setsuna
    for <strong>her resolve.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When looking at the story again as a big picture, there exists an incredible
    amount of nuance that had elevated this seemingly generic love triangle
    story to something much more ambitious and well thought out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's first sum up all of the key events in the WA2 again, by chronological
    order should make the most sense to me so:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Haruki met Kazusa</li>
    <li>
      The two had a pretty <strong>rough</strong> start (all thanks to Kazusa
      ofc kek) but they slowly gained momentum
    </li>
    <li>
      Shit happened and they ended up at <strong>square one</strong> again
    </li>
    <li>Haruki met Setsuna</li>
    <li>
      Setsuna "connected" the two (again) through music which also marked the
      start of the <strong>trio</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Kazusa remained obstinate as she tried to <em>push Haruki away</em>, only
      Setsuna was allowed to be in close proximity
    </li>
    <li>
      The three continued to spend time together as that fateful concert drew
      near.
    </li>
    <li>
      Setsuna and Haruki declared to be a couple (but{" "}
      <strong>what really happened</strong> that day?) (*)
    </li>
    <li>
      Kazusa loosened herself <em>a bit</em> but not so much (lel): for Setsuna,
      she declared that she was her mortal enemy and <em>best of friends</em>,
      for Haruki she just kept on the tsundere mode.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally the ice melt, Kazusa could not hide her feeling anymore and came
      down with an <strong>emotional outburst</strong> toward Haruki
    </li>
    <li>
      Things spiraled out of control and the trio fell apart, Haruki and Setsuna
      separated, Kazusa left Japan.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Phew, that sure was a mouthful, but the most critical event here from how I
    see it is <strong>number 8 </strong>since it was later revealed that it was
    Kazusa who actually dealt "<strong>the first strike</strong>", yet she
    lacked the courage to stick with it till the end and gave up midway, and it
    was at that exact moment that Setsuna came in hot to deliver the decisive
    blow which inevitably set up the course for the trio to a most unexpected
    and probably painful path in later developments.
  </p>

  </figure>
  <p>
    If I have to be honest, there was <strong>nothing </strong>wrong with
    Setsuna's answer to the matter for many reasons:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      All is <strong>fair </strong>in love and war
    </li>
    <li>
      Kasuza <em>could not finish what she started</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      Which therefore made Setsuna being <strong>"technically" </strong>the
      first comer.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    I know this is getting a bit semantic as, usually, you wouldn't apply common
    math or physic in love, for there is more to it than meets the eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    For one thing, Setsuna was <strong>fully aware</strong> of what was lying
    under the hood between Haruki and Kazusa, since she is very sharp and well,
    it's woman's intuition, and you can bet yer ass that{" "}
    <em>nothing can ever escape their instinct.</em>
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-05-30-21_42_45-Greenshot.webp"

      loading="lazy"
      width={1920}
      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    By committing that move of "striking" Haruki "first", one can argue that
    Setsuna basically <em>betrayed </em>Kazusa because didn't they already
    proclaimed themselves to be best of friends or something?
  </p>
  <p>
    Like normally, you would have to sit back and relax and have some{" "}
    <em>girly consulting section</em> before making a move right? Clearly,
    Setsuna witnessed the whole kissing thing with her own eyes, so by "
    <strong>procedure</strong>", they would go like,{" "}
    <em>
      "KYaaaaa, so outrageous, I'm so having a long chat with Kazusa about this
      when school's out hehe".
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    But nah, she instead went for the kill <strong>immediately</strong>, and
    right at the moment where Haruki was <em>most vulnerable</em> as well, one
    can even call this out as cheating.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      This kind of girl-to-girl relationship has always been my thing
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>But I digress.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>First comes first serves</strong>, Kazusa had had her chances, A LOT
    in fact, <em>not just</em> from that brief moment before Setsuna making her
    move, but way back when she and Haruki first met.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, she kept getting held back by her <strong>pride </strong>and the tricky{" "}
    <strong>circumstances </strong>that she was in (such as being considerate
    for Setsuna), thus resulting in a rather unfortunate development right at
    this pivotal moment.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-05-31-02_02_47-Greenshot.webp"

  </figure>
  <p>
    Even though her fabricating the harsh, icy surface was understandable thanks
    to her family background, the end result remains that she had{" "}
    <strong>wasted </strong>too much of those precious opportunities to settle
    this matter before it was even a thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>But what the hell do I know.</em>
  </p>

  </figure>
  <p>
    In the end, Kazusa was just a girl at that age, being completely unaware of
    her <strong>true </strong>feelings and clueless about{" "}
    <strong>how to express</strong> herself (which is again due to the family
    issue), which leaves us to the <em>good ol' fashioned</em> "Only when you
    lose something will you realize its value" scenario.
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-05-31-00_48_50-Greenshot.webp"

  <p>
    Haruki, on the other hand, was something I'd like to call a{" "}
    <strong>victim </strong>of this miscommunication mumble-jumble. Regardless,
    I don't disagree that it's wrong to put all the blame on him for being so
    indecisive <em>even when the truth was laid out in front of his eyes</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, the whole track "<strong>Todokanai Koi</strong>" which
    translate to "<strong>A Love that cannot be</strong>" was written{" "}
    <strong>by Haruki for Kazusa</strong>, meaning he had already{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>given up on her</em>
    </strong>{" "}
    the moment the ink was dried, so having things developed in a totally
    unexpected way while he already <strong>moved on</strong> with Setsuna just
    gotta further fucked things up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I mean yeah I agree that he should have chosen to either break up with
    Setsuna or ditch Kazusa totally, but as I said,{" "}
    <em>things weren't as simple as it was.</em>
    <br />
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-05-31-01_31_38-Greenshot.webp"

    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    For one thing, Haruki had already got<strong> too involved</strong> with
    Setsuna, and I don't want to play the calculating game here, but I
    wholeheartedly believe{" "}
    <em>Haruki has more affection for Kazusa than he does Setsuna</em>,{" "}
    <strong>BUT NOT BY A LARGE MARGIN</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's why it was so fucking difficult for him to make the call. He felt
    terrible leaving Setsuna after having been through so much "venturing"
    together, especially given the fact that <em>he even met her family.</em>
  </p>
  <figure className="kg-card kg-image-card">
    <img
      src="http://testghost.mo.cloudinary.net/image/upload/q_80/v1/gaftonosh/2021/10/2021-05-31-01_14_22-Greenshot.webp"

      className="kg-image hoverZoomLink"
    />
  </figure>
  <p>
    In the same vein, ditching Kazusa was more or less as pernicious of a
    decision to make because Kazusa was almost literally <em>on her own</em>, so
    for her to have made some <strong>actual friends</strong> only to get "
    <strong>separated</strong>" in every way possible was just too cruel.

  <p>
    Long story short, for Haruki, picking one of the girls would mean a{" "}
    <em>death sentence</em> to the "team", the <strong>trio </strong>(it was the
    music that got them together after all), and even worse,{" "}
    <em>one of them would have been left alone. </em>Therefore I think it was
    understandable for Haruki to be entirely dumbfounded and{" "}
    <strong>
      <em>had no idea what to do</em>
    </strong>
    , you can call youth or whatever, but it is what it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rest is just as you have already known; everything escalated to a
    sinister game of <strong>feigning consideration</strong> which eventually
    got everything upside down at the pacing of an avalanche (how fitting of the
    setting).
  </p>
  <p>FYI, I'm not writing this post to denounce any of the characters.</p>
  <p>Setsuna was drawn into a corner, and it was justified.</p>
  <p>Kazusa had her own circumstance, and it couldn't be helped.</p>
  <p>
    And Haruki was just either too dumb or too naive to read the air, but I feel
    like I'm not in any position to judge because{" "}
    <em>high school was a lot more delicate </em>as far as I recall so lol.

  <p>
    So yeah, in the end, I think WA2 is a dauntingly beautiful and tragic love
    story that managed to{" "}
    <strong>capture some of the most powerful emotions</strong> and thought
    processes when it comes to romance in general and high school relationships
    specifically.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way things developed slowly but surely coupled with the snowy setting
    just simply accentuated the story's <strong>depressing overtone</strong>,
    thus creating a ride so unpleasant to get through yet hard to resist.
