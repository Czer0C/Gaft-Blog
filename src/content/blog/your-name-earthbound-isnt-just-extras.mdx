    Believe it or not, I picked up this side story novel in the eagerness of
    some juicy fanservice from Mitsuha’s greatness, only to get 1/10th of what I
    was baited promised and received something completely unexpected. So was
    this novel a mistake? I think not, in fact, I think it’s fucking worth it.

  <p>
    There are 4 chapters in this novel, each focuses on the narrative of a
    different character. While I’m a bit salty that there was no Mitsuha’s POV,
    I find this kind of 3rd person approach pretty refreshing, as I got to know
    more about both Mitsuha and the character narrating the story at the same
    time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The novel kicked off with a relatively pure fanservice chapter featuring
    Taki mostly doing some “experiment” on Mitsuha’s body. To tell the truth,
    it’s pretty fun to read, the people’s reaction was spot on to the sudden
    changes and how things played out with their daily activities feel
    compelling enough to make it less tedious of a trip.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I do find the boob joke rather repetitive, the writing made sure to
    mitigate that by adding some extras every time it’s been mentioned, so welp.
    If anything, Taki does get some spotlights here with how his opinion on
    Mitsuha changed over time as he underwent more body swap with her. One of
    the biggest concern regarding the romance of the anime is how “forced” it
    was, and this chapter pretty much settled that problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I was wondering what kind of whacky shit gonna happen next, the 2nd
    chapter took a complete 180-degree change in tone, to a more serious one as
    well as expanding worldbuilding and characterization. The protagonist of
    this chapter (Teshigawara) really hit the spot to me, mostly since I can
    relate to him to a certain extent.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the anime, he’s pretty much a background character, but the novel made
    sure to fill up that hole and turned him into something interesting enough,
    especially his goal and mindset which I really enjoyed. This also explained
    his actions in the anime and thus made it feel more natural. And of course,
    got to know more about Mitsuha, mostly about what she had to go through
    before the main event in the anime, which is cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 3rd chapter’s main focus, from how I see it, is actually the lore of
    Your Name. I always feel like the anime didn’t do well in this regard as it
    solely relies on visual to tell the tale without going in-depth of the
    matter, so this chapter pretty much fixes that issue. Not to mention there
    were some pretty cute interactions between Yotsuha and Mitsuha (real and{" "}
    <em>
      <em>fake</em>
    </em>{" "}
    ones). Overall a pretty balanced chapter if I have to say.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the first 3 chapters were quite entertaining in some ways, the final
    one took me by complete surprise with a stunning approach that managed to
    “connect” everything in the anime as well as this novel. At first, I thought
    it’s just a random drop of flashback to expand the side cast, but I was
    wrong, there’s more to it than it looks.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I kept reading it started making sense with how things went in the anime,
    and I finally understood the real meaning of the theme it was trying to
    deliver. “Everything ends up where it should be”, such a simple phrase, yet
    best describes the whole story behind Your Name.

  <p>
    With all that being said, while I did enjoy reading this novel, the fact
    remains that it’s just a mere supplementary of the main story, which also
    means a double edge-sword. A good story is one that should stand on its own,
    having to rely on other instances is no doubt a major drawback unless said
    material possesses a strong enough impact to go toes to toes with the
    original version, which is, sadly, not something that Earthbound had
    accomplished.
  </p>
  <p>
    In conclusion, Earthbound was worth reading despite going against
    (“surpassing” should be more precise lmao) my original anticipation. It’s
    not anything breakthrough, the writing is simple (a bit dragged on though),
    yet managed to give me some food for thought every time I finished a
    chapter, and that ending sure is something…
