# New begin

## Started another template and hope to be the last as well:

- Switched to MDX for flexibility instead of typical CMS that is costly and hard to maintain
- Leverage the power of island by Astro to go completely static for a much faster performance
- Some cool new styling over the legacy design, but will bring back some of them in time to not neglect on UX and reading experience
- 100% free because vercel and cloudinary are quite generous.
